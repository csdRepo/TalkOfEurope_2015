  – To begin with, there are a number of statements. Five days ago, the sad news reached us of the death of the French journalist, Gilles Jacquier, who was killed at Homs in Syria. Last year alone, over 100 journalists met their death in the course of their work. The European Parliament has always upheld freedom of speech. We have defended, and will always defend, those who uncover the truth and bring it to the attention of public opinion.

In the shipwreck of the Italian cruise liner, at least six people have died and about a dozen are missing. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to extend our condolences to the families of the victims. This accident should not have happened. We trust that everywhere, the appropriate lessons will be learned from this disaster.

News has reached us of the death of Manuel Fraga Iribarne. Yesterday, Spain and Europe lost a great statesman: one of the main architects of democracy in Spain and the founder of the People’s Party, some of whose members are with us in the Chamber. The late Mr Fraga Iribarne was himself also a Member of the European Parliament in the 1980s. I would like to offer our condolences to our fellow Member, Mr Fraga Iribarne’s daughter, Carmen Fraga Estévez, and ask her to convey them to the whole family.

The eighteenth of December last year saw the passing of Václav Havel, who was President first of Czechoslovakia and then twice of the Czech Republic. Europe, and not just the Czechs and the Slovaks, has lost a symbol of the Velvet Revolution, someone who, in particular, is a symbol of the renewed union of our continent. He was a courageous statesman. As we all remember, two years ago, in November 2009, Mr Havel was a guest in the European Parliament. We received him then with a standing ovation. Today, we all pay tribute to his memory. I was present, on behalf of us all, ladies and gentlemen, at the funeral of President Havel in Prague. It was a very important ceremony: a European ceremony, and one which was important even beyond the borders of Europe. About a dozen Heads of State or Government were present. In profound reflection, we bid farewell to a great European and a great Czech.

I would like to ask you now to observe a minute’s silence in honour of both departed statesmen.</literal>

  – I declare the sitting open. I would like to remind you that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, no business shall be transacted while the outgoing President is in the chair unless it is concerned with the election of the President or the verification of credentials, and so today, I am not allowing any comments or discussion. The only thing we can do is elect the President of the European Parliament – that is what it says in our Rules of Procedure.

This morning, in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Procedure, we have to elect the President of Parliament. Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure says that nominations shall be with consent and may only be made by a political group or by at least 40 Members. In accordance with the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure, I have received the following three nominations for the office of President of the European Parliament – I already notified you of these nominations yesterday, but I will read them out again today – Nirj Deva, Martin Schulzand Diana Wallis. I would like to stress that the candidates have informed me that they consent to their candidature.

Ladies and gentlemen, we come to the ballot procedure. I would like to ask you not to leave your seats too early, because I am going to give most of the instructions about the ballot in Polish, so if you leave your seats and do not have your headphones, you are not going to hear me.

We now come to the ballot. I would like to remind you that in accordance with Rule 14(1) of the Rules of Procedure, the candidate who obtains an absolute majority of the valid votes cast is elected. Blank or void ballot papers are not considered as votes cast. It is a simple rule.

First, I will proceed to choose eight Members by lot, eight fellow Members whose job it will be to count the votes cast in the ballot. Their names will be drawn by lot from a box containing the names of all the Members.

Here is the box with the names of the Members, and I am pulling out successive names: Borsellino, Sógor, Panayotov, Poc, Bagó, Kalinowski, Kalfin, Perello Rodriguez.

Colleagues, please come and stand behind me on the podium.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am now giving precise instructions about the ballot. You have also received these instructions by e-mail, but I understand that not everyone has had time to read them, so I will go through the different phases of the ballot. First, ballot papers and envelopes will be distributed. Distribution of the ballot papers and envelopes can now begin.

Now we come to the ballot. May I remind you again that for a candidate to be elected, an absolute majority of valid votes cast is needed. After receiving your ballot papers, please mark the box next to the name of one of the candidates. So we mark the box of the candidate for whom we are voting. You can vote for only one candidate. If two or three candidates are marked, the vote is void. If comments of any kind are added, the vote is void. If you want to change your vote, this can be done. To do so, please return your paper with the vote to the people who are distributing the papers and take a new paper, but you have to give back the old one.

I am not going to read out the names of the Members who vote. Please stay in your seats. What is important here is that the names of the Members who have voted have to be recorded in the Minutes, so please sign the list of those entitled to vote before placing your paper in the ballot box. Please sign the list at the ballot box. I would also ask you to have proof of identity with you and to show it. You should place your ballot paper into the envelope, having first folded it into four. The Members appointed to conduct the ballot and to act as tellers will vote at the end. That is everything. I understand that you have a question about the ballot procedure.</literal>

Martin Schulz has received an absolute majority of the votes cast and has been elected President of the European Parliament.

I would now like to invite you, President Schulz, to come to the podium and replace me in this chair as the newly elected President of the European Parliament.</literal>

               –Mr President, my dear Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and on my own behalf, I should like to congratulate you and to congratulate our new President. I wish you a great deal of courage, lucidity and strength to guide this institution, which collectively represents 500 million Europeans, in the most dignified and responsible way possible.

However, I should firstly like to pay tribute to Nirj Deva and Diana Wallis who also stood as candidates to the Presidency of this institution. I should like to say to them that, although the two main groups in this House took the political decision at the beginning of this term of office to entrust the Presidency of Parliament to one of their own Members in turn, my group respects Mr Deva and Ms Wallis for standing as candidates and thanks them for their contribution to this election.

However, this morning, Mr Schulz, I should also like to thank your predecessors and, in particular, Jerzy Buzek, whose capabilities as a statesman, which were already well-known in Poland, have been of great benefit to Parliament. Mr Buzek and, before him, Hans-Gert Pöttering and all their predecessors, starting with Simone Veil, the first President of the European Parliament to be elected by universal suffrage, all of the Presidents here today who have succeeded one another, have, in their own way, strengthened the powers and competences of this institution. Your political action, Mr President, will follow their lead.

Mr President, for years we have had the opportunity to work together as chairs of our political groups. For the most part, I do not share your political convictions and our respective political groups have differing opinions on a number of subjects. This has not stopped us from placing our trust in you because, in the difficult situation facing Europe, what brings us together is far more important than what divides us.

You are determined, as you have just told us, Mr President, to defend the European general interest resolutely in the face of diverse national interests. My group can only support you fully in this mission, in this action, knowing that the coming months will be one of the most critical periods that Europe has experienced since its creation.

In our view, you have three priorities: defending the Community method, supporting the Community method and safeguarding the Community method.

Nothing is more important than defending European heritage, namely, guaranteeing the general interest, protecting the small States from the bigger ones, and respecting their points of view without allowing it to lead to a deadlock. Nothing is more important than coming out of the crisis on top, through greater European integration, and nothing is more important than showing our citizens that the euro will be a strong, sustainable currency, insofar as we are doing what we should have done since its creation, namely, implementing political and economic governance. Finally, nothing is more important than preserving the common good that is solidarity between 500 million Europeans.

Ladies and gentlemen, by creating what would become the European Union, the founding fathers have left us with a challenge the likes of which has never been seen, namely, uniting the destiny of countries and peoples who, in the past, tore one another apart and fought against one another for centuries.

Adenauer, Schuman and de Gasperi rose to this challenge, and their successors, to this day, have kept this European dream alive in spite of the economic and internal difficulties, and in spite of a radical shift in the global geostrategic situation. It is our generation’s responsibility not to fail in this task. It is up to us to overcome the financial crisis, the current crisis of confidence, to guarantee our children – and you have said it yourself – not only a viable future, but, above all, a better future.

This is a challenge primarily facing you, Mr President, and us, ladies and gentlemen, as elected representatives of the people of Europe.

It is up to you and us, along with the European Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, to display enough responsibility to convince our States that shared sovereignty, that real economic and political convergence, are our best tools to face the challenge of growth.

Mr Schulz, as President of this institution, you will have to face many external challenges, and the PPE Group will be at your side to help you in the European spirit I have just mentioned. We would also encourage you to transmit this message to countries such as Ukraine, where Yulia Tymoshenko has faced unacceptable treatment, or Syria, where the population’s will to change has been unspeakably repressed.

You are also planning to improve the internal functioning of Parliament and I welcome this. Your predecessors have largely paved the way and the recent adoption of a code of conduct is fully in keeping with the desire for greater transparency and greater responsibility from each of the Members.

My group will therefore support you on this front.

Mr President, from now on, you will be leading an institution unlike any other in the world: a plurinational Parliament, which votes on legislation. For two and a half years, you shall be the leader of a House that does not seek to impose on the Council the idea that we will not overcome our current difficulties by creating a new treaty, a new Parliament, new governance, but that seeks to convince the Council of this.

Mr President, we will join forces behind you each time you defend this integrated Europe, this Europe of solidarity, this Europe that delivers innovative solutions. We will join forces behind you each time you plead the case of common European policies, as well as each time you fight for funding to live up to the ambitions of these common policies. Finally, we will join forces behind you each time you defend and promote the ideas and values that are the foundations of our Union beyond our borders, namely freedom, tolerance, respect for the weakest in society and solidarity. Mr Schulz, I wish you every success in your Presidency.</literal>

               –Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I should like to warmly congratulate you on your election as President of this House. I should like to tell you that it is an honour for our group that a prominent Member, such as yourself, will be leading us throughout this next stage in Parliament at a time – as you have said – of many problems, many threats and many risks for Europe and for Parliament itself: risks for fundamental rights, the unemployment problem, the economic and social crisis, and also the risk that Parliament could lose power by drifting towards intergovernmentalism.

I believe, however, that, precisely because we are experiencing a difficult period, we need people with special qualities. We need people with great ability and strong European convictions, people with great fighting spirit, and people with great passion to lead a project. Mr President, you are someone who possesses all of these qualities.

I have had the opportunity to work with you for some time and I know what I am talking about. I believe that the start of this Presidency in the face of all these conflicts – with you as President of this Parliament – represents an opportunity for us to show that we are capable of getting Europe, which has been drifting somewhat, back on course.

Today, you are no longer President of our group; today, you are President of all of the Members of this House, but I should like to remind you that what is at stake and what will always be at stake is the issue of building a more united, more democratic, fairer Europe for the people and not for the merchants. I should also like to tell you that you will always find us by your side in the quest towards this objective. I wish you good luck and success in your work.</literal>

               –Mr President, Mr Schulz, I should like, both personally and on behalf of my group, to congratulate you on your election, but also to congratulate the other candidates who ran in this election. I must add that I enjoyed your first speech, Mr President; even though it started in a slightly social-democratic tone, by the end, it was clear that it really was the President who was speaking. Therefore, I must tell you that you have taken very quickly to your new role.

However, allow me, Mr President, to first address your predecessor, Jerzy Buzek, with whom I worked for many years in the European Council. We can both testify to the fact that the climate is much better here, within the European Parliament, than it was in the European Council. I must say, Mr Buzek, that you have carried out remarkable work within Parliament. You have ensured that we adapted to the Treaty of Lisbon which had to be implemented. With Parliament’s help, you have conducted all of the policies needed to combat the crisis. I, and all of the other chairs in the Conference of Presidents, have truly enjoyed how we have been able to cooperate with you. Thank you very much, once again, for all the work you have carried out for this Parliament.

Mr President, throughout the campaign for the Presidency of Parliament, I heard many of my fellow Members say to me: ‘Yes, what we need is a neutral Presidency. What we need is a President who does not vote. What we need is a President who does not have an opinion’. I must say that I found this belief rather surprising. I prefer to side with those who believe that we need a President who has an opinion and who is not neutral because it is not possible, Mr President, to remain neutral in the face of the rising intergovernmentalism we are seeing today.

It is not possible, ladies and gentlemen, to remain neutral when we are faced with a Council which continuously devotes itself to denying the Community method and the Monnet method. It is not possible, ladies and gentlemen, to remain neutral when we are faced with constant attacks against the Community method both within the Council and outside it. Nor is it possible, I believe, to remain neutral when we are faced with rising nationalism and populism in Europe, which contradict our European values.

I should therefore like you, Mr President, to be a President, but I should not like you to be a neutral, asexual President without opinions. On the contrary, I should like a President, Mr Schulz, who represents the European Parliament, who represents the European interest without fail, who is different to a President of the Member States and the Council. I should like a President who fights for European integration and – why not say it, let us use the word, we were not able to use it for decades – I should like a President who fights for European federalism as Monnet, Schuman, de Gasperi and Spinelli wished to do.

I should especially like, Mr Schulz, if it is possible, a President who speaks to the Member States when he goes to the Council – you will be invited, into this House of the European Council, with all due respect, as President of Parliament – who takes advantage of this opportunity, as your predecessors did, to tell the States the truth and to tell them that only a single fiscal, economic and political Union will save the euro.

Finally, Parliament must pave the way to be followed. Parliament must now assume its responsibilities, with the Commission, with the European Central Bank, and pave the way forward to resolve the crisis. It is very clear, it is very simple. Europe is not the problem in this crisis; Europe is the solution to today’s problems.

Finally, I call upon you to indulge your former fellow group chairs and to show some flexibility when it comes to speaking times. In any event, let me remind you that I always overrun my time, Mr President.</literal>

               –Mr President, before explaining my reasons for congratulating you, I would like to thank your predecessors. The Presidents of the European Parliament whom I have known, like Jerzy Buzek, Hans-Gert Pöttering and Mr Borrell Fontelles, have always found their way of doing things, which always seemed to be appropriate to the challenges in hand. I would also like to thank the other candidates because they have once again shown how internal democracy works.

Nonetheless, Mr President, the majority you have now achieved is a qualified majority. There are good reasons for this. In my opinion, what we have here is not a Social Democrat who has been elected to the highest office in the House, but rather a Social Democrat who has been elected to the highest office in the House and who has also been a fantastic parliamentarian.

You will remember that when you asked me what I thought of the idea of your standing for President of Parliament, I said: ‘What ever gave you that notion?’ I simply could not imagine how Martin Schulz would cope with the diplomatic constraints of this office, as our chief representative. I can imagine it perfectly well now. Firstly, I would like to express the hope that you will not relinquish your particular personal skills and that you will not allow the diplomatic formalities so often required of the President to stifle the spiky pugnacity that has made you such a difficult customer in this House, but that you will retain this bullish attitude in your new office, using it to good effect in your dealings with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, or Mr Van Rompuy, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy.

The promise that you made in your personal campaign had something touching and almost naïve about it: if this ‘all for one’ principle works, then the principle of ‘one for all’ will work too. Parliament has played its part well today in setting the stage for a new regime. We can now expect serious debate in the House, however, and it will be necessary to prove that not only is Parliament’s new President prepared to take a different approach in debates, but also that Parliament is ready to stick to the objectives that it formulates.

This immediately brings me to the present disagreement with Viktor Orbán. Things went wrong during the discussions around the media laws, at a time when a lot still could have been achieved in Hungary. This was mainly because, in the end, Parliament finally left it up to the Commission to deal with the problems. We cannot allow this to happen again in the current disagreement with Hungary. Also, since the name of Yulia Tymoshenko has already been mentioned here, and I expressly applauded, let me say this: we cannot have a situation where Hungary, a Member State of the European Union, abandons the democratic values of the European Union at a time when the people of Russia have started on a path of opposition to controlled democracy and when the Ukrainians are in a desperate situation. Ladies and gentlemen, together with the institutions and our newly elected President, we must do all in our power to prevent this!

Martin Schulz, I believe you are assuming office at a time that is even more difficult than I believed before Christmas. I would never have believed that the last crisis summit really would have had no influence over further developments. I have just returned from Japan, where I saw how the Yen, the currency of a country with enormous problems, has sky-rocketed against the euro. That is not normal. There is no point in complaining about the rating agencies. The problem is that politicians have so little influence, that the rating agencies and the games of Chinese whispers played in the big banks have a bigger influence than political decisions in Europe; this is not normal and we need a calm and consistent approach. I do not believe that the whole Parliament is now populated with Social Democrats. However, many of the ideas for tackling this crisis put forward in this House and supported by a large majority must also be pursued to the end in our dealings with the Council and Commission. We need to put an end to our habit of agreeing to the next compromise before our ideas have even been aired.

Mr President, I wish you every success. I know that you can be a thorn in people’s sides. On behalf of my group, I can say that we will certainly also play a similar role. I want to make a point here, too, for the women here in Parliament. Following in the footsteps of Simone Veil and Ms Fontaine, it would be wonderful if we, the women in Parliament, started preparing the ground today, so that the next President in the next legislature will be another female President.</literal>

               –– as we shall now have to get used to saying – on behalf of the ECR Group, let me offer you my full congratulations on your election as President of this Parliament and let me also thank Jerzy Buzek for all the work that he has done over the last two-and-a-half years. I have only had the pleasure of working with him for the last few weeks, but certainly he has been an extremely able and competent President and will be an extremely hard act for you to follow.

Mr Schulz, you toldmagazine just last week that apparently, people are tired of decisions being made behind closed doors. I have to agree with that statement, but it is not without a certain irony given the manner of your election. You had a good majority here this morning; however, your victory was not overwhelming, as I am sure you will have observed. Let me also thank Diana Wallis and my colleague, Nirj Deva, for turning this into an election rather than a coronation. They should both be very proud of the efforts that they have made to have a full debate about the office of President, about what it should involve, and how it should be conducted. Mr Deva obviously fought the election in his typical low-profile manner and we are certainly very pleased with the way that he proceeded!

Nevertheless, Mr President, you are in the Chair now and we wish you well over your next 30 months in office. From our group, you can expect courtesy, you can expect respect for your office, and we will work constructively with you despite our obvious political differences.

I did not agree with many of the statements that you made this morning, but that is a debate we will have on many other occasions, I am sure. That is the nature of democracy: we all respect each others’ points of view even when we differ. I hope that you will treat all groups equally, and all Members equally and with great respect for the elected office that they hold, whatever the section of this House that they come from.

Your first major engagement will be representing this House at the European Council meeting in a couple of weeks’ time. I am sure that all the Heads of Government and Presidents are greatly looking forward to hearing what you have to say – after all, they have not heard from many Socialists round the Council table recently, so I am sure they will be pleased to have your reflection on these issues. In that meeting, and in all other meetings that you have to conduct as President, I would like to wish you all the best for your term in office.</literal>

               –Mr President, Mr Schulz, today, I have the difficult task of standing in for our chair, Mr Lothar Bisky. I am pleased that I have been entrusted with this and that I am, therefore, speaking on his behalf when I, first of all, warmly congratulate you on being elected President. You have achieved a majority in a single round of voting. However, I would also like to extend the warmest thanks to the candidates who stood against you for providing a counterbalance. They have done their very best and I hope that, in the future, we will have many more such occasions where people are willing to stand for President. Personally, I find it rather unfortunate that you are not a woman, but we simply cannot do anything about that now. I hope that you will show your feminine side every now and then.

A lot of Members have voted for you. I am sure that many Members did that with your best interests at heart, but I am equally sure that there are also some Members who thought: let us give Mr Schulz a run for his money. To put it more plainly, you have been elected at a very tough and difficult time, at a time of crisis. I believe that the European Parliament has a very big role to play in this economic and social crisis. We are, in fact, the only institution directly elected by the citizens. At the present time, the citizens are afraid of losing their jobs and pensions, they are concerned about the affordability of health care, about their provision for retirement, but also about the future of their children. My hope is that those citizens are the very people you are planning to give a voice to. That is what I am asking you to do. I am aware that in many bodies of the European Parliament, money and large interests often play the greatest role. Yet those citizens are the people we are actually here to represent.

A lot of agreements are struck behind closed doors, where the public cannot see the negotiation process. I hope that you will ensure that that process becomes more transparent, but also that, during that process, you will articulate the full variety of views of the groups in the European Parliament, both large and small. You are, after all, the President of us all. We from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will call you thoroughly to account in that regard and I wish you great reserves of wisdom in the coming period.</literal>

               – Mr President – President Schulz – good morning to you. I know it is my job to congratulate you but, given that we knew this result two-and-a-half years ago, as a result of a stitch-up, there really does not seem to be much point. After all, nobody in modern-day Europe would ever have a big, powerful job that was decided upon by a full, open process. I am sure Mr Barroso would agree.

I was musing this morning. I was thinking about what kind of President Schulz we were going to get. Are we going to get a dignified, calm figure who behaves like the Speaker of all great parliaments around the world, somebody who puts himself above politics and the nitty-gritty of the day-to-day arguments and is an ambassador, indeed a statesman? Or are we going to get the Martin Schulz we have got to know since 2004 as leader of the Socialist Group? You know the one I mean: snarling, angry, unable to control his temper, intolerant of anybody with an alternative point of view, somebody who is contemptuous when, in free referendums, people have the temerity to vote ‘no’, somebody who is anti-British to his fingertips and does not like free markets? I was wondering which one we would get. Well, your opening speech has settled that question for me. It is pretty clear that we are going to have two-and-a-half years of political fanaticism from the Chair. I have to say that only a third-world country, only a banana republic, would want to have an overtly political President of a parliament, but that is what we have got.

Mr Schulz, I may represent the smallest group in this Parliament, but I can tell you that it is a group whose ideas and whose views are now being echoed by a growing number of citizens right across this continent. I am sure you would agree that the opinion polls show that it is about 50-50 whether people think this EU is a good thing or a bad thing. What we represent is not anti-Europeanism. That is not what it is about. We believe in nation-state democracy. We want a Europe of trade, we want a Europe of cooperation and we want a Europe that is responsible. We do not want a Europe that seeks to be a global superpower. We do not want a Europe run by Mr Barroso and the Commission, and the so-called Community method.

I will do my very best to provide political opposition to your Presidency over the next two-and-a-half years and I hope you give us a fair hearing.</literal>

  –Mr President, Mr Schulz, I would, first of all, like to congratulate you on the election deal struck two and a half years ago, thanks to which you now find yourself sitting in that seat. I must congratulate you on that, on behalf of my group. I find it unfortunate, though, that we have not had a debate about your election. We would have liked to have had one, but all right, it seems that the outcome was determined in advance. You have emerged the winner at the ballot box, so you are the person that we will be dealing with.

Around a year ago, you unfoundedly denounced a member of my group as a fascist in this Chamber, which is conduct unbefitting a democratic parliamentarian. You have never attempted to distance yourself from those words. You said that loud and clear in this Chamber and that kind of rhetoric is not to your credit. I find that really unfortunate and I hope that you now want to take those words back because, Mr President, a democracy is only a democracy if dissenting opinions are allowed to be heard unimpeded. There is, obviously, no reason to call someone a fascist and there is no place for such words in this Chamber. We have all been democratically elected and we are also democrats at heart, and, as such, we must also respect each other.

Mr President, this European Union is bankrupt. The citizens have never had so little faith in the future of the European Union. More and more people want sovereignty returned to Member States. Small countries can definitely be prosperous and cooperate peacefully – because that is precisely where Europe’s strength lies – under the military flag of NATO. Therefore – sorry, Mr President – but all that war rhetoric is inappropriate. Fortunately, we have had decades of peace in Europe, at least in our part of Europe.

Ladies and gentlemen, the megalomaniac Europe of the social democrat Schulz is bankrupt. Europe is lagging far behind, it is corrupt and wasting money. We all need to do something about that. Mr Schulz, I hope that you will also be, or rather become,president, that you will leave your Social Democratic past behind you and that you will stand above all the group divisions. I hope that you will show yourself to be a worthy President and that you will show respect for all the democratic currents represented in this Parliament. While the non-attached Members do not belong to any one group, they have been democratically elected and are entitled to equal treatment from our President and everyone else in this House.

Mr President, although we do not share your vision of a European social-democratic utopia – for we believe in the power of sovereign nations – we still want to get our cooperation with you off to a good start. I therefore wish you success in your new role. You would make a very nice start if you finally delivered on a long cherished wish of this Parliament, namely, the abolition of the travelling circus, that wasteful travelling circus that shuttles between Brussels and Strasbourg. Mr President, that is what I wanted to convey to you. It would be a nice touch if you could clinch that at the next summit. I wish you every success in your new role as President. We will do our best to get your presidency off to a good start.</literal>

It is unthinkable to have to vote in a House surrounded by Members who are able to see how their neighbours are voting.

  Mr Atkins, if you had been present yesterday evening you would have heard the detailed explanations. The Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament state that those who receive a qualified majority of the votes cast in the first or second ballot will be deemed to be elected as Vice-President. Because no candidate achieved this majority yesterday, we have to hold a third ballot.

The number of candidates does not exceed the number of vacant positions. I therefore propose that we should declare the candidates elected by acclamation. The precedence of the Vice-Presidents shall then be defined by the number of votes cast in their favour. Does anyone oppose this procedure? Then all 14 are now deemed elected.</literal>

  Having consulted with the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and because there are so many Members urgently awaiting the results of the Vice-Presidential ballot, I am going to announce the results of the ballot now. There are also procedural reasons for doing so. Parliament’s senior positions are only fully constituted after the results have been announced and accepted by Parliament. For that reason I would ask for your patience while I quickly go through this.

All 14 candidates are deemed elected. The order I now announce is the order of precedence of the Vice-Presidents in the second half of our electoral term. In other words, the first name I read out is the first Vice-President, and so on until we reach position 14.

I will now read the results in the order of votes cast.

Number of votes cast: 672

Invalid voting slips: 17

Valid votes cast: 655

The candidates have received the following votes:

Gianni PITTELLA: 319 votes

Miguel Angel MARTÍNEZ MARTÍNEZ: 295 votes

Anni PODIMATA: 281 votes

Alejo VIDAL-QUADRAS: 269 votes

Georgios PAPASTAMKOS: 248 votes

Roberta ANGELILLI: 246 votes

Othmar KARAS: 244 votes

Edward McMILLAN-SCOTT: 239 votes

Isabelle DURANT: 238 votes

Alexander ALVARO: 235 votes

Rainer WIELAND: 230 votes

Oldřich VLASÁK: 223 votes

Jacek PROTASIEWICZ: 206 votes

László SURJÁN: 188 votes

As I have already said, all candidates are deemed elected. This is also the order of precedence in which they shall perform the functions of the Vice-President in the absence of the President.

I therefore ask whether there is anyone who objects to the election of the aforementioned candidates?

This is obviously not the case. Therefore all are now deemed elected. Allow me to congratulate you all.

The composition of the new Bureau will now be made known to the Presidents of the institutions of the European Union. I would be very grateful if the chorus of congratulations could be postponed until this evening’s group meetings.</literal>

               –Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, chairing the Council of Ministers of the Union at this time is not an easy task, but I am sure that, after your training as an MEP, Prime Minister, you are fully equipped for this task.

Madam President, I endorse the four priorities under which you have so classically positioned your six months at the head of the Council, namely, responsibility, European dynamism, green Europe and security. I welcome these ambitions, I share them, but as everyone here knows, a Presidency never chooses its agenda, and it is the political reality of the day that will serve as your guide.

That is why I call upon your Presidency not to be content with being a technical Presidency; yours must be a Presidency that is, above all, political, given the wide range of issues facing you and facing us. That is also why I call upon you and your Presidency to work closely with this Parliament, which you know well but which some members of your government would like to be faster and more efficient in its decision making. You know how things work in Parliament, however.

My group and I are, of course, in favour of fast, effective legislative action, and, in recent times, the markets have either taught us or forced us to work more quickly than before. However, I am also in favour of the proper functioning of democracy and transparency.

I am sure, Madam President, that your Presidency will be able to find its place alongside Parliament, the Commission and the European Council. Once again, I urge and I call upon you to engage in politics, because the times in which we live demand that European actors do not simply oil the wheels and build bridges, but also that they be committed and audible actors.

The first week of your Presidency will be dominated by negotiations on the fiscal treaty, on which opinions differ greatly within this House, both with regard to its timeliness and its methods. My group wants this Presidency to be fully involved in this negotiation and especially wants it to defend two major principles to its partners in the Council: European integration in fiscal and economic budgetary matters, of course, but also in politics and the Community method.

Since this is the time for making wishes, I would add that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) would be very grateful to you if you could set the first discussions on the financial perspective on the right track. This is not an easy dossier, but when things are not easy, we must have courage. Of course, the reforms we are trying to put in place on the recovery of public finances and growth will be your top priority, but the capital debate which, because of the way things are, Europe will have to hold with regard to its finances for the 2014-2020 period, should not be neglected either. I have always said that a euro used here, in Europe, with the Commission, was a whole euro. A euro used in a country recording a deficit is already no more than 30 or 40 cents towards growth.

Here, a euro is a whole euro. If the Danish Presidency manages to hold these debates on good foundations, that is, without taboos, especially as regards own resources, if it is able to show the Member States, as Parliament says, that money is much better spent at European level on large-scale horizontal projects than if it is divided up, you will have earned all of our respect after your Presidency.

Madam President, in view of the efficiency and courage demonstrated during presidencies held by countries which are, let us say, not as large as others, I believe that the time has come for presidencies to be ambitious, as Poland has just been, and I believe that, although your country has opted out of several common policies, such as monetary policy, you can, and indeed you must be bold in your proposals. Help Parliament to convince the Member States that the solution to our problems will come from greater convergence and greater Europeanism and that, this way, the solution will quickly become much more tangible for our fellow citizens.

I wish you all the best for the next six months.</literal>

               . –Mr President, naturally I also want to extend my official congratulations. I am aware of your great tolerance in relation to speaking time. This tolerance is something you inherited from your predecessor and I would like to thank you for it before I begin.

Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, this debate about Europe is being conducted against the backdrop of a difficult situation, Let us be honest: many of those who arguably have more say in determining the fate of Europe than we do in Parliament are not in fact here. I am referring to the financial markets and rating agencies. It is completely unacceptable that we should so often find ourselves the victims of the capricious enforcers of financial market developments and the ratings agencies. They are simply exploiting the weakness of Europe. The weakness of Europe is that to date we have failed to find a joint solution or have only succeeded in finding certain solutions with difficulty. This is something that the rating agencies prove to us on a daily basis: if we do not have joint solutions, then we will find ourselves making it up as we go along, which is no way to manage European policy. That is why I support everything that has already been said, including in relation to the Community method. Prime Minister, you underlined this correctly. As you rightly said, it is important that we should move away from a one-sided policy of austerity. The rating agencies leave us in no doubt here either in their most recent downgrades: a one-sided policy of austerity will not really allow the budgets to be corrected. Should we not be concerned when the– let me emphasise: the, a publication not known for its left-wing views – writes as follows:

‘The conclusion of the fiscal treaty, which is the top priority of EU politics right now, is at best an irrelevant distraction.’ An irrelevant distraction.

This really does give us food for thought. It is, however, the social problems that are the consequence of this irrelevant distraction.

Prime Minister, you said it yourself: let us look at Romania’s current position. What has happened there shows that unsocial austerity policies do not work. As you quite rightly said, it is important that savings should be made. However, this cannot be at the expense of the poorest members of society. That is exactly what is happening in Romania today.

I can only urge everyone to find a way back from the brink and to reinstate the primacy of the social state in Europe. Without a social state we will never get control of budgetary problems. I am not arguing against reforms, which are necessary here and there. I am arguing against the questioning of the fundamental principles of the social state we are witnessing today, however. That is when social unrest occurs, when we have massive restrictions on civil rights and when the police are the dominant power on the streets. Events in Bucharest and in other cities should really give us plenty to think about.

You mentioned the education sector. The story is the same here. We recently put our weight behind the Lisbon Programme: our aim is to be the most competition-oriented and most competitive region, specifically on the basis of our education, training, science and research. What do we see happening today? Resources are being cut. Not only are they not being increased, they are actually being cut. I believe that this is extremely damaging. When you referred to the ‘no future’ generation, you should know that it has already arrived. In your programme you rightly said that we need Europe to be at work. Unfortunately, what we often witness today is a Europe of rising unemployment. Let me make an admission: my group wants to see Europe at work. We fully support your approach. This can only happen – and I would like to make this quite clear – if we link environmental concerns, the workforce and employment policy. We are absolutely against viewing these as opposites.

That is why we shall work with all the stakeholders – including the unions – to ensure that new jobs are created, that the environment is protected and that sustainable development is guaranteed. The Danish Presidency has our unconditional support in this regard.

You also mentioned energy efficiency. This again is an issue close to our hearts. We must become more energy-efficient. This is something we can achieve. There are plenty of good examples, we simply need to follow them. I believe that the most important thing here is that our pride should be restored. Europeans must be able to take pride in Europe. We are confronted with our problems when we travel to the US or China, for example. Things were quite different 10 years ago. I would like things to be different again after the Danish Presidency and would hope that we can once again take pride in Europe.

I would like to close with a short comment – after all I do not wish to stretch the patience of our new President. Before my election, our group had some exemplary debates in the most positive sense. I should also like officially to thank my fellow Members, particularly Catherine Trautmann and Stephen Hughes. We are here today as a cohesive group. We remain a cohesive, able partner for our colleagues in this House and, of course, for the Presidency and for the European Commission. We all have different expectations from Europe: a social Europe, a fair Europe, a green Europe. Above all – as we shall discuss this afternoon – we want a democratic Europe. Democracy must prevail in all of our Member States. We are ready to talk, however. We aim to work together to create this Europe.

With this in mind I would like to congratulate you once again, Mr President, as well as all the Vice-Presidents. I believe we have made some excellent appointments to the House.</literal>

               Mr President, I think that the Prime Minister has one priority, namely to find a way out of the two crises we are going through at the moment – the euro crisis, and the crisis concerning European values.

I think that one thing is crystal clear: the half-measures that have been taken over the last two years have not worked, and all the bilateral meetings between Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy have not worked either. They only calm the markets for 24 hours, and then everything starts again. We have to say, as has already been mentioned here, that the recent decision of Standard and Poor’s has been attacked by all – or perhaps I should say most – European leaders. I am not a big fan of the rating agency either, but I think that, instead of complaining about them, the European leaders today should read their reports and the message they are giving, because what they are saying is in fact true.

I was disappointed that Mr Barnier, Mr Rehn and others reacted in that way because when you see – and when you read – what Standard and Poor’s is saying, it is true. They describe the lack of political courage and unity in Europe as the main problems at the moment. They describe the misinterpretation of the crisis. They are saying that it is not only a financial crisis – a fiscal crisis – but also a trade imbalance crisis. They describe the need – maybe it was the Socialists who wrote this – to help countries that are cutting their expenditure to achieve some growth too.

Thank you for the applause for Standard and Poor’s. So they are right that the crisis is far from over and that we still need a sustainable solution. Let us be honest about this. The solution is not on the table for the moment. What we need are stability bonds, common bonds – choose whatever name you want. The German proposal for a redemption fund is also a very good idea. But if you want this crisis to be over, you have to act now.

That is not just my opinion, or our opinion here; it is also the message from Italy’s Prime Minister, Mario Monti, in today’s. He says that he is not complaining about the downgrading of the ratings: the problem is the persistent policy weakness at European level. He also says that he does not just need a pat on the back from Mrs Merkel, but a commitment regarding Eurobonds and the Eurobond market. He is right. There is no sustainable solution for Italy with today’s interest rates of six or seven percent. The only way that he can come out of this crisis is to continue with his economies and savings, but at the same time we must lower those six or seven percent interest rates on the Eurobond market. Otherwise we are asking an impossible task of Mr Monti. It is not fair to say that it is very good to continue with your austerity programmes and at the same time to continue having interest rates of six or seven percent.

The second point, Prime Minister, is that you have another crisis to tackle: the crisis concerning our values. Not just in Hungary: look also at what is happening in Romania today. I know that the Commission has started a number of infringement procedures. I hope that we will find a majority here in Parliament to launch the procedure based on Article 7 of the Treaty.

By the way, Mr President, congratulations. You will give me more time now, will you not? You are an Italian, you do that in Italy. My final question to you, Prime Minister, is very clear. The Commission is starting infringement procedures. We should be starting a procedure under Article 7 of the Treaty. My question is, what will the Council be doing over the coming days? Will you, Prime Minister, put it on the agenda of the next European Council? I think it would be a mistake if you do not do so. The core of Europe is not only about money and about the euro, but also about our liberties and our values.</literal>

               . –Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, it is an honour to welcome you here today. You will no doubt be aware of the reputation that precedes you. Because you represent a red-red-green government in Denmark, my group naturally has very particular expectations from you, not just because of your political background and this refreshing new start for Denmark, but also because, with your decisively female Scandinavian way, you represent a new force in the urgent debate concerning Europe. I could imagine your charmingly sober approach to politics, which I noted in Copenhagen, is also an instrument that you could use to challenge your German opposite number in the context of crisis politics. That is precisely what we expect from you. We expect you to take another critical look at the Treaty we have been debating since the last crisis summit. We believe that this Treaty is not just a diversion from crisis politics, but also an insult to European democracy. It not only excludes the European Parliament, but also fails to take national parliaments sufficiently into account. This is quite unacceptable.

I also believe that, for example, the European summits that are now to take place in an informal way in the future, will be difficult from Denmark’s perspective because they shift the balance of power in the Council in an unwelcome way. So much for these difficult treaty-related technical issues. I believe that such democratic questions are of enormous significance for the continued functioning of the European Union. The substance of this Treaty has been rightly criticised by the previous speakers in this House. The completely one-sided focus on stability has not only failed to resolve the crisis, but actually made it worse and I now find it almost unbearable to hear in each plenary how we are even deeper in crisis than before the last crisis summit.

This morning the World Bank hit the headlines with the news that it remains of the view that Europe is collapsing into crisis and will drag the rest of the world with it. How long can this go on?

Your programme contains some elements that indicate that you want to do things differently in your capacity as the Danish President-in-Office of the Council. Go ahead. Do not wait until halfway through your Council Presidency, but rather start the debate right now. We need these investment programmes to help the economy recover now. Your ideas on climate protection, which were very well prepared by Connie Hedegaard, and your ideas on energy efficiency, could provide the stimulus for jobs in the European Union. You have no time to lose, however.

We have already heard mention several times today of the construction of the entire financial market regulatory system. I fully agree that we must discuss the question of Eurobonds or the Redemption Fund and that this is an issue that can no longer be put off.

Let me also say a word on the role of the European Central Bank in this debate: it is still a huge problem that we believe that we can have a common currency and that we can defend it without having a truly jointly functioning European Central Bank or without authorising the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). This message has also been repeated like a mantra by many speakers. It has been picked up and developed by the rating agencies but has not had sufficient effect in the Council or in the key Member States to date.

My plea to you, as a former colleague, as Prime Minister and as President-in-Office of the Council, is as follows: as a woman, do things better than your predecessors. Do not procrastinate, but follow your political convictions in the Council. Hungary, which is the subject of this afternoon’s debate, is an excellent example of how the Council and Commission have allowed a problem to fester, deflecting attention from it, and are now having to pay the price for the way in which the country has developed. The Commission and Council share responsibility for what happened in Hungary during the Hungarian Presidency of the Council.</literal>

               Mr President, let me welcome Ms Thorning-Schmidt to the Chamber this morning. From a UK perspective let me congratulate her on being the first member of the Kinnock family to make it to the office of Prime Minister. It will be a great surprise to many in the UK that finally one has made it. Denmark is an historic ally and the military personnel of Denmark served with great distinction alongside personnel from my country, from France and from others in defence of the people of Libya, and we owe you a great deal of gratitude for that.

I welcome the fact that Denmark is taking on the Presidency at such a crucial moment, when Europe stands on the brink of a political and economic catastrophe. My hope for the Danish Presidency is for some plain speaking. It is sometimes said that the most courageous act in politics is speaking truth unto power. The Presidency has begun well with its frank assessment of the damage that a financial transaction tax would cause to the gross domestic product of Europe.

I hope the Presidency will continue in this vein and tell all the leaders of the European Union that the time has come to face the truth about the eurozone and about Europe’s fundamental economic weaknesses, because the last Council was a staggering missed opportunity. Instead of facing reality, instead of tackling these problems, the Council has embarked on yet another round of introspective, institutional navel-gazing.

We must never forget that we are currently in the midst of not one but two great crises. The eurozone is the most immediate problem, but we must also not lose sight of the fact that Europe faces a fundamental challenge to its international economic position. We are losing competitiveness in the global marketplace; we are falling behind more dynamic regions of the world. We are allowing bureaucracy to stifle enterprise and regulation to hamper innovation.

As we work towards Europe in 2020 we need a growth agenda which creates jobs and which encourages businesses. The European Union must focus on stimulating economic reform and developing the single market. We therefore support some of the key priorities of the Danish Presidency.

On the Multiannual Financial Framework, we welcome the fact that it should be viewed in the context of needing to consolidate public finances. A budget that looks to the future, and not to the past, and a budget that strives for cost-effectiveness – as suggested in the programme – is very welcome from our point of view.

We need all Member States to take a similarly realistic, unrestrained view of the EU budget. We would like a budget freeze, and we want the focus on spending existing resources more efficiently and more effectively. We also look forward to the efforts of the Presidency to emphasise the need to revitalise the single market, because we share the vision of Europe as an open region for trade, an open region for investments. Economic openness is also a precondition for increased growth and employment.

Much of the programme seems to use the language of the 21st century to describe tried and failed policies of the 20th century. The Presidency programme speaks of more regulation, it speaks of a responsible economy, and it speaks of effective standardisation. All of us, politicians and officials, need to remember that every additional regulation comes at a cost. This must be paid for either by consumers when buying the goods or services or by workers who lose their jobs as employment is exported overseas.

There are aspects of the programme that we would deplore; we are alarmed by some of the thinking behind initiatives in the field of external relations and in the field of justice and home affairs. The Presidency should not, for instance, promote the Commission’s proposal for a common corporate tax base. It should have the courage to try and kill off such an ill-conceived and dangerous proposal. With that, let me wish the Danish Presidency well and we look forward to working constructively with them to advance the cause that we all believe in.</literal>

               . –Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Danish Presidency and the Danish Government. Congratulations on having just passed your first 100 days in power as the new government in Denmark. At the elections in September, Helle Thorning-Schmidt and her allies put a clear question to the Danish people: are we to get ourselves out of the crisis by investing or by saving? Are we to overcome the crisis by creating jobs or by creating unemployment?

The Danish people gave their answer by electing Ms Thorning-Schmidt as Prime Minister. The question that the Danish Prime Minister asked during the Danish elections is even more relevant in the EU as a whole because, as has already been said, the EU is experiencing the deepest crisis that it has ever faced. More than 10% of our citizens in the European Union are unemployed, with 5 million in Spain alone – which is more than the entire Danish population – and youth unemployment is catastrophic. Two thirds of EU Member States have a youth unemployment rate above 20% – in Lithuania it is over 30%, in Greece over 40% and in Spain almost 50%.

Therefore, it is also disappointing to read the programme of the Danish Presidency. It could almost have been written by ‘Merkozy’. Gone are the ideas of investing our way out of the crisis and back are the demands for savings to get us out of the crisis. Honestly speaking, however, is there anyone who believes that we can overcome the current crisis by ordering cuts and reductions? The EU tried this in Greece. It did not work. The EU tried again in Greece. Still it did not work. Now we are trying for a third time in Greece, and it will still not work!

The Danish Presidency’s programme bears the grand title ‘Europe at work’, but the policy that is presented will lead to more unemployment. My group believes that this is completely the wrong approach to take. I would like to finish by saying to the Danish Presidency that people in the Member States do not need more cuts dictated by Europe. They do not need euro pacts or financial treaties to reduce public services and cut wages. People in Europe need jobs to improve their shared prosperity. The Danish Presidency has six months to show us that it is part of the solution and not part of the problem.</literal>

               . –Mr President, it has been exciting to witness such a genuine love story over the last half an hour. I can assure you that Ms Thorning-Schmidt is exactly the sort of Prime Minister that you are all longing for. She was educated at the bureaucratic academy that is the College of Europe in Bruges, taught and trained here in the European Parliament’s sacred halls and came to power purely on the basis of a whole string of lies told to her electorate in exactly the same way as the whole of the EU was established. That is certainly a President-in-Office of the Council that you can be proud of and that you will be able to embrace. I can promise you and everyone in the Commission that you will also be infatuated with Ms Thorning-Schmidt. You are yourselves the epitome of people who rule and govern without a popular mandate, without so much as a single voter ever having voted for you.

At a time when more and more Danish voters are angry that they voted for Ms Thorning-Schmidt and would like to change what they did, you are certainly a model for this government, a perfect match. Where you needed to appoint puppet governments in Greece and Italy to do your bidding, Ms Thorning-Schmidt and the Danish Government will deliver everything on a silver platter. There will be no protests, no conflicts, only loyalty. What more could you ask for?

In this regard, therefore, I just have one friendly, but heartfelt, appeal to make to Ms Thorning-Schmidt: come to Brussels, come to Strasbourg, spend all of your time over the next six months here in the EU institutions. I say this primarily because it will prevent your government from destroying conditions in Denmark, but then also because the damaging of effect of you being here will be minimal in relation to the EU.

The EU is already a supertanker with a leak. The water has already covered the lowest decks. The other day we saw how even the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which is the instrument that is intended to rescue the whole of the euro area, was downgraded by the international credit rating agencies. Yet what is the tune that we hear being played? It is more violin playing, of course, just like on the Titanic as the water rushed in.

Ms Thorning-Schmidt, welcome to the EU. Here you can get what you want. Your friends Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso and Mr Schulz are all here. Here you can mould the state that you want, but that no one else outside these walls wants. Here you decide, not the electorate. What you might have to lie about to get in Denmark, they get served on a silver platter here. This is a love story that is worth following.</literal>

The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will vote in favour, even the Danish Members. Thus, we do not really know what the Danish Government thinks about this, and that is actually the best thing that we can say about the Danish Presidency.</literal>

               Thank you, Mr President. Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt, I am afraid I have never in my life before heard quite so much hollow rhetoric and empty words as I have heard from you today. You seem similar to Mr Barroso, in this respect. What you said was meaningless, from start to finish, just like the stuff we are used to hearing from the Commission and Mr Barroso. Europe has been promising economic growth for fifteen years already, has it not? The Lisbon Strategy promises that Europe will be the strongest economy in the world, but what a joke that has turned out to be. In reality, European socialism has resulted in mass unemployment, bankrupt countries, economic decline and politicians who are only out to fill their own pockets.

However, I wish to make an urgent appeal to you, because the Netherlands has a big problem with Europe. The Netherlands has one of the best social systems in the world and we are proud of that and, yet, Europe, European bureaucracy is working to destroy the Dutch system. What I mean is that it is unacceptable that European migrant workers should have the right to benefit from social services after spending onlyyear in their host country. You should have to spend at least ten years in a country before being able to avail yourself of its social services. But Europe prohibits us from imposing that condition. It is very important that the Netherlands is given scope to protect itself from all those Romanian and Bulgarian fortune hunters and keep them out of our social system, so that it can continue to exist for the benefit of Dutch people. Would you, therefore, put that at the top of your agenda, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt?</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like to start by welcoming the Danish Prime Minister here to the European Parliament. We have been looking forward to the Danish Presidency and we hope that it goes well. There are a few of us who will give it our support. Even though there have been a few speakers in a row who were not entirely satisfied, I believe that most of us here in this Chamber would agree with the Danish Presidency on the four priorities that it has set out.

We have a major and obligatory task in the economic sphere with the fiscal compact, the ‘six-pack’ and, in particular, with the forthcoming budget. I do not believe that Denmark should be content to just run the office over the next six months. It is important for the whole of Europe that we have a Presidency with aspirations, a courageous Presidency that has the courage to set an agenda that can make a difference – even if this causes disagreement. Once the economic agenda is on track, I would like to see Denmark get to grips with the energy sector. There will be disagreement here, it is said, but it is essential that we find a solution.

In 2011, the EU spent EUR 315 billion buying in oil for Europe, and by focusing on energy efficiency we can save a great deal of money, which can then remain within the sector. Unfortunately, we see that Europe’s enterprises and citizens are currently becoming more and more dependent on gas from Mr Putin and oil from the Middle East. If we have a more stringent directive in the area of energy efficiency, we will increase Europe’s competitiveness, our innovation and, in particular, our capacity to operate on the global markets. Last but not least, it will create a huge number of jobs for blue-collar workers – we will create the growth that we so desperately want in Europe. If there is one area in which Denmark ought to achieve its objectives in the next six months, this is it. I hope that the Presidency will take up the fight, despite the fact that there are some people who disagree. I would like to wish you luck with the Presidency and with producing sound results that will ensure green growth and green research in Europe.</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Thorning-Schmidt for her very clear and very ambitious plan for the forthcoming Presidency.

The four main headings – a responsible Europe, a dynamic Europe, a safe Europe and a green Europe – set a course for the EU that is absolutely the right one at this time. I believe that many Europeans feel that the EU is a bit remote, that it is something vague that goes on in Strasbourg and Brussels, but that perhaps does not have any great relevance to their everyday lives. The reality, however, is quite different. This could not be further from the truth. The decisions that are taken in these buildings have enormous consequences for people’s everyday lives from Amsterdam to Athens, from Cyprus to Copenhagen. When we talk about a responsible and dynamic Europe what we are talking about is the need to create growth and jobs, but we of course have to do so at a time that also demands frugality. This is a difficult balance to find. It is something quite different – in fact it is the complete opposite of what Mr Messerschmidt and Mr Søndergaard said. Mr Messerschmidt spoke of ‘the perfect match’ and ‘love affairs’ – in this regard, I have to say that the far left and the far right are united in their criticism of Europe and are sending out a message to the effect that countries, like Greece for example, that are not able to make cuts themselves should be left to their own devices. This is obviously something that has an impact, not because they are right, but because it shows how damaging it is if we do not stand together in Europe.

A green Europe is another vision. This is a vision that holds that, at a time of crisis, we must not neglect the environment – on the contrary in fact! By doing something good for the environment and for the climate we can also create jobs and growth. Take the Energy Efficiency Directive, for example. Here we say that if, in Europe, we reduce our COemissions internally by 25% – we can do that by being 20% more energy efficient than we are today – we can create 2 million jobs. That means jobs for 2 million Europeans who do not currently have one. That is where we can make a difference. That is where we can make the EU visible. That is where we can demonstrate that when we stand together across borders we can make a difference for the better.

A safe Europe relates to the fact that cross-border crime and terrorism are things that cause concern and create insecurity. Here, too, we can make a difference if we work together across borders. Overall, this is a far-sighted, down-to-earth and very ambitious Presidency programme. I wish you every success.</literal>

  Mr President, I welcome the Prime Minister to where it all started for her.

Allow me to address the Prime Minister in English, as I intend to compliment her and her government, and the last time I complimented Commissioner Reding in this plenary, it was translated as criticism. Therefore, as the Prime Minister is not used to me complimenting her, I want to avoid any misunderstandings, because the message is also for this House.

I want to compliment the Danish Government on three things. I want to compliment you on having listened to this House in drawing up your priorities, and on sticking to what is already on the table. This makes for a Presidency programme which is ambitious yet pragmatic. It shows that you have clearly understood your role as an honest broker. And finally, you and your ministers have done your homework and have been extremely industrious, with a high number of preliminary talks with Parliament. Thank you for that. I am sure you will get the support you have asked for today.

But, before the Prime Minister gets carried away by all these compliments, I had better ask a few critical questions. Firstly, how will the Prime Minister navigate the emerging minefield of new intergovernmental agreements and avoid European disunity? Secondly, what is the Danish position on a ‘Tobin tax’, which – according to the Commission’s latest figures – could cost around 130 000 jobs? Lastly, we are currently discussing family reunification rules and the Commission’s Green Paper. Now that Parliament’s President, Mr Schulz, has withdrawn his earlier critique of the 24-year rule, will the Prime Minister seize this opportunity to start working for an EU-wide 24-year rule? Those are my questions.

Prime Minister, I wish you the best of luck in the Presidency.</literal>

I would like to start by saying that I think it is refreshing to see a strong and visionary woman at the head of Europe, a Europe in which there are a great many dusty, grey suits. I think that we are in need of a breath of fresh air, and I believe that you are able to provide that. The most important thing as far as I am concerned is the fact that the Danish Presidency is to a large extent making it a priority to find a common European solution to the crisis. It involves focusing hard on creating green growth, sustainable growth and new green jobs. That is what millions of European citizens who are currently out of work need. My own generation, the young people in Europe, is the hardest hit, and I am pleased that you have taken up the question of solidarity between generations here today. I think the Danish Presidency could even go a step further and ensure that we set the halving of youth unemployment as a new 2020 objective and that we work towards providing a European youth guarantee to ensure jobs and education here during the crisis.

Finally, I would like to say that it is vital for us all to recognise that cuts alone will not solve the crisis. Cuts have been on the agenda for a long time, and for a long time it has been about giving each other a haircut. Now it is time to kick start our economy, to create new jobs and to ensure that our crisis solutions are fair. Following your speech today, I have very high expectations that the Danish Presidency will succeed in this task.</literal>

  –Mr President, welcome Prime Minister. There are major challenges ahead of the Danish Presidency over the next six months. Among other things, it is expected that the Danish Presidency will focus on reforming the EU’s energy consumption. This is a huge challenge, as the Member States all have such different needs. I hope the Presidency will support the development of completely new renewable energy initiatives. Wind, water and solar energy are quite simply not enough.

Denmark has taken over the Presidency during a grim period. The economic crisis is having major consequences for the people of Europe, who are already being hit hard by unemployment, which is something we are hearing from all sides today, particularly among young people. We can change this if we strengthen the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are suffering very difficult conditions right now. As you said yourself, it is time to kick start growth. I do not expect the Presidency to spend time making amendments to the Treaties that do not have the support of the people. The crisis must not be used as an excuse for more EU bureaucracy. The time should instead be spent on tangible results, realism, increased competitiveness and strengthening the internal market.

Other important matters also need urgent attention, as we are hearing from our fellow Members. The reforms of the fisheries policy and agricultural policy are matters that are on the table right now. At a time of financial deficit and demands for national savings, it would be appropriate for the EU to demand one base for this Parliament and to make substantial cuts in both agricultural and fisheries subsidies. We know that, in their current form, these two areas do not work as they are supposed to, but they nevertheless cost citizens dearly.

  Mr President, we have experienced four years now of harsh austerity across Europe and the results are perfectly clear: a downward spiral is being forced on Ireland, Portugal and Greece; millions are now facing misery, with parents in Greece giving up their children because they cannot afford to feed them; and the economy of the EU as a whole faces the potential for a recession in 2012.

Both the Prime Minister and Mr Barroso spoke about growth but, when you read the programme, it is clear that what we have here is business as usual – talking about growth while implementing austerity – and there is obviously a particular emphasis within the programme on the implementation of economic governance. Economic governance pure and simple is a method of institutionalising austerity at the expense of democracy across Europe.

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results; and that is precisely what we have here. Is it insanity or is it simply a means of ensuring that the bondholders get their pound of flesh at the expense of working people?

Finally, can I ask about the attitude of the Danish Presidency and the Commission as to the prospect of a referendum in Ireland on the austerity treaty, which goes even further in institutionalising and enshrining austerity? Will you respect the legal and political right of the Irish people to a referendum and to vote freely without a campaign of fear or blackmail?</literal>

  –Mr President, Prime Minister, I wish you every success in your Presidency over the next six months. I should like to make two specific proposals as an addendum or improvement to the Commission’s current policy. In the energy sector, your Presidency could take the initiative of inventorising all existing energy sources in Europe. We need to know what energy sources the European Union has at its disposal and which of our investments in the energy sector are not realistic; for example, we have photovoltaics in countries where there is no sunshine. We therefore need to inventorise existing energy sources.

My second proposal is that an initiative should be taken in the employment sector. Yesterday’shad a piece on the mass exodus of labour from the European Union. We need to examine this change in the fabric of the labour market in the European Union.

I propose these two initiatives in the energy and employment sectors.</literal>

               Mr President, Prime Minister, I hope that you are aware that many people in Europe have high expectations of the Danish EU Presidency. Your country has been one of the few Member States of the EU to have taken the courageous and necessary measures to keep the problem of immigration under control. That has not always been welcomed by other governments or by the European Union itself.

Your country also took a brave position in response to the ‘cartoon crisis’, as it has been dubbed, in defending the rights to free speech and freedom of the press in the face of Islamist intolerance. Although you represent a different majority government, Prime Minister, I hope you will defend the right of Member States to pursue their own asylum and immigration policies, because it seems to be the case at present that, because of a lack of external border controls, we are having to deal with both a Schengen crisis and a euro crisis.</literal>

This is something quite new for us from a Danish perspective and we shall do all we can actively to support you in this programme, both in implementing the individual measures – for example in relation to the regulation of the financial markets – as well as your efforts to make the Community method a success as the yardstick for European policy, rather than the intergovernmental method – this is something you expressly emphasised. We will be with you all the way, Prime Minister, if you seize this initiative.

There is one thing I would like to add: please guide Denmark back from its eurosceptic stance. Denmark has an opt-out clause in the euro area. You have the opportunity not only to stabilise the euro, but also to reverse current Danish opinion and to take an active step in favour of the euro.

There is one other thing I would like to add: we will support your programme. However, I read several times in the preliminary notices that you wish to make a move in Turkey’s direction. You did not mention this today. Prime Minister, please do us a favour during your six months holding the Presidency and, in view of the forthcoming Presidency, persuade Turkey to drop its opposition to Cyprus, which will hold the Presidency after you. This would be a real success in relation to Turkey. If Turkey intends to continue blocking Cyprus, then I would have to say in your six-month report that you perhaps did not manage to fully succeed in your mandate in this regard. Please take up this issue. We stand behind you.</literal>

You have said that the economic crisis is central, but I know that you and your team came very early to this House in a very organised way to deal with the issue of values, to deal with the issues of justice and home affairs. You have not shied away from these very sensitive and difficult topics. All of our countries, including yours, have had very difficult times with these issues. What you have done is to address, rather than shy away from, what you call the building blocks of legislation, which are made in the House.

As co-legislators, we want you to please maintain your attention as a Presidency on the difficult issues of Schengen – one of the core values and building blocks of this Community – the common asylum system and the victims package. These are building blocks, which, like the asylum and migration package, have been delayed for so long. We look to you, your Presidency and your team for an effective move on these things.

Regarding the issue of Hungary, we want to see some volume from the Presidency, because we are a Community of values as well as a Community that wants to deal with the economic crisis, which is central.</literal>

The issue concerns values. The Presidency has to take part, with this Parliament, the Council and the Commission, in addressing issues which are of concern – in my country and in every other country – about fundamental values. It is not about the Hungarian people; it is about the need to address the policy of the Hungarian Government, or the policy of any government that may – I stress, may – be breaching fundamental values. It is something that we need to care about but it is not, of course, the only issue that exists in terms of importance in this House.</literal>

  –Mr President, Prime Minister, I would like to start by thanking you. Immediately upon entering office, you reversed the snap decision of the previous regime to reintroduce border controls between Denmark and Germany and Denmark and Sweden. I believe this was a very good decision. My group favours an open Europe. This was good news for those citizens living in the border regions. It was also good news for business, particularly the transport companies on either side of the border. Thank you for what is a really positive step.

In my second point I find myself agreeing with Mr Langen: please defend the Community method. You have already seen what happens when we revert to the intergovernmental patterns of the 19th century and the attitudes associated with them. At least this is what has been reported in the media in relation to what Mr Sarkozy had to say to you. If this is the new tone we can expect from the intergovernmental method, then this is another argument in favour of the Community method.

There is one important point to make, however. In setting out your priorities for the Presidency of the Council you state that you want the European Union to have a strong, consistent external profile. I believe it would be good if you could use the opportunity afforded by this Council Presidency to initiate a debate on whether you really wish to maintain your opt-out from the Common Security and Defence Policy. It is strange that every country except Denmark is a member of the European Defence Agency. I would be extremely grateful if you could take advantage of this opportunity.

Finally, my group, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is pursuing a procedure against Hungary under Article 7(1) of the Treaty. It is then up to the Council, however, to make any recommendations. Article 7(1) only provides for recommendations. I would encourage you: place this on the agenda and organise the necessary four-fifths majority of Member States. This is the only way we will make any progress with regard to Hungary.</literal>

As the rapporteur for the Energy Efficiency Directive, I will try to move this Parliament into a position where we can reach a deal with you. Today, however, I want to address one issue which I think is crucial in relation to getting investment in the short term, and it concerns the European Investment Bank. In December 2008, 27 heads of state decided that in 2009 the lending capacity of the EIB should be raised from EUR 55 billion to EUR 80 billion. That meant in 2009 that there was EUR 25 billion more concrete investment in wind and other projects as well as corporate bonds, which saved part of the European car industry. Today we are in the same credit crunch, yet for next year the EIB has reduced its lending capacity to EUR 60 billion. Why, at this very moment, are we cutting back EUR 20 billion in the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank?

Secondly, why is the EIB not using what Mr Draghi has provided as a lifeline for the private banks? Private banks now have EUR 500 billion at 1%, and they are parking it overnight in the European Central Bank and not investing it in the real economy. So, why is the EIB not able to lend EUR 80 billion at 1% in 2012 and invest in the European economy? Is that not the single quickest investment stimulus we can get during your Presidency?</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is sinking, the stock markets are collapsing, and the centralist Europe of the financial lobbies is falling apart, but the Danish Presidency has begun its term by promising total loyalty to the Commission’s plans to make the continent into an economic superstate.

Rather than focusing on implementing measures to safeguard the future of 500 million citizens, the Danish government has promised to be a faithful guard-dog of the Council’s euro-technocracy. There are also other passages I also do not agree with.

First of all, I cannot see how accelerating the EU enlargement process to include the Balkan States can be seen as a priority at the moment. There are other problems that need to be tackled immediately, before worrying about how to integrate countries affected by corruption and criminality into Europe.

Then there is Turkey. The Danish Government is pushing strongly for Turkey’s membership. Luckily Turkey is a long way from meeting the entry parameters set by the EU. However, the true paradox is that at a time when the euro is risking failure it should be Denmark to save it, given that Denmark is not in the euro area, never having trusted the euro, apparently with reason.</literal>

  Mr President, the Prime Minister is taking on the Presidency of the EU at a time when unacceptable behaviour threatens democratic principles. Such behaviour has become endemic and institutionalised in the European Union. In recent months we have seen elected leaders being bullied out of office and replaced by unelected technocrats, by an over-dominant German leader and her French poodle. With a possible new treaty on the way, the EU apparatchiks are desperately looking for a new way to include all 27 countries without the need for a referendum. So much for democracy. No wonder people across Europe are rioting. The message is there for all to see, but the EU turns its head away.

Prime Minister, you again hold the Presidency at a decisive moment: the possible demise of the euro. At a time of crisis and uncertainty the EU is looking to the Danish Presidency for a strong lead. How telling it is that a country from outside the eurozone is taking the helm. The EU is looking to the IMF to help bail out the troubled euro. How telling it is that the UK, a country from outside the eurozone, ridiculed and threatened here in December, has been asked to prop up the IMF at this time.</literal>

  –Mr President, Ms Thorning-Schmidt, ladies and gentlemen, the advance information about its agenda includes the indication that the main priority of the Danish Presidency of the Council of the European Union is to guarantee a responsible European economy.

What does this mean? In my view a more responsible Europe is first and foremost a Europe that is aware of the risk it is running. Today the biggest obstacle to this is the European leadership. It is not the euro that is in danger. In the euro area there are countries that have accepted the currency, but not the sense of political leadership. The worst situation is the immobility of our leadership in the continent. This is particularly true for countries in trouble that are in dire need of being driven by the force of the colossus that is Europe.

Therefore, I hope that in this regard the achievements of the Polish Presidency, which never lost sight of our real priority at this time, will be continued. This priority is to strengthen our unity, as the only invincible weapon for warding off dangers we cannot even begin to imagine, but which are in fact more real than many of the forecasts that only serve to make us look arrogant in the eyes of the world and of our citizens.

I would like to take the opportunity, Mr President, to wish you every success in your work and to confirm that we will support you in the battle you announced yesterday to re-affirm the rights of parliamentarianism and the contribution that parliamentarianism has made to the integration of Europe, which has been so badly damaged by the method of this agreement.</literal>

In times of crisis, selfishness and a lack of solidarity emerge. Let us reverse this trend by harmonising austerity with solidarity.

I am rapporteur for the revision of the Maternity Leave Directive, which the European Parliament adopted in October 2010. To date, despite the efforts of the Polish Presidency, the Council has not responded to Parliament’s proposal. Parliament is ready for and interested in dialogue with the Council and the Commission, so as to find an appropriate solution to this situation, which serves European families and is in line with the Europe 2020 strategy’s targets. This is an important issue, all the more so because Europe is facing a serious demographic problem that limits economic growth and jeopardises the sustainability of social security.

Could you reassure us of the swift implementation of legislative proposals on derivatives and the two regulations which must accompany the overhaul of the Stability and Growth Pact? We really do need these texts. Majorities – particularly a political majority – are forming on the tax on financial transactions; could you give us your exact political position on this matter?

Next, I should like to draw your attention to trade policy. It is the Council that gives the Commission the mandate to negotiate on the Union’s behalf. It is a competence of the Union, and we, the European Parliament, have a new political competence to approve treaties on trade. I should like to draw your attention to the need to avoid being naïve and the need to apply the principle of reciprocity; for example, will proposals on negotiations with Mercosur be exchanged at the end of your Presidency? I would advise you to be very careful.

Prime Minister, we are celebrating the decisions adopted during the last Council, but it is my hope and wish that they do not remain mere words, but that they also become actions and come to fruition as soon as possible.

We must send a solid message to the markets. Up to now, they have been very welcoming of the measures. Furthermore, there is a sense of eagerness for cooperation and a spirit of willingness, both of which we will continue to have great need of over the coming months.

We must maintain and continue to consolidate our efforts in favour of stability and continue to put our trust in austerity measures, but these must be accompanied by other measures to generate growth and, therefore, employment.

We cannot recover from this crisis through austerity measures alone. We need to bring reforms to fruition, not just debate them. Spain is showing that it is fully committed to this idea. That is why we are supporting the structural reforms that must be implemented by the Member States.

The European Central Bank, for its part, has demonstrated courage when taking decisions, but it must show greater commitment through more active participation in the secondary debt markets. Furthermore, the common financial mechanisms that have been debated at such length in this House must be implemented.</literal>

I would like to say that, in fact, studies show that the happiest people in the world live in Denmark, and it would be absolutely splendid, if, during this Presidency, you could spread even a little of this happiness to a Europe that is seething with distrust.

Presidents generally set so many priorities that, ultimately, nothing is a priority. The same applies to European years, which often vanish, with no traces of them remaining. At present, the Union is celebrating the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations. This is also a particularly crucial issue from the point of view of the economy. Prolonging careers and safeguarding the durability of pension systems are issues of human dignity, but they are also very important matters for the economy. That is because it is an inescapable fact that ageism has now reached new levels in the European Union and in all the Member States, on account of this present economic recession. There are, of course, shining examples of active ageing in our midst: Jacques Delors, Helmut Schmidt and others. Make this a priority.</literal>

Allow me to translate what my Socialist fellow Member was proposing: if you put Hungary in your sights, your programme will succeed. I, however, do not share this opinion. I am very pleased to see that your presidency programme reflects the same intention that the Hungarian Presidency had set as its objective just one year ago, namely the intention to create the second pillar of the economic union by coordinating economic policies on a Europe-wide scale. Well, now is your chance to launch this process in a responsible manner.

As a Hungarian MEP, I am perfectly aware what it is like to work with dedication towards common policies while being outside the euro area. A prominent part of your programme is the strict monitoring of every constituent of economic governance. This task does indeed call for a clear head and rational thinking, but above all else, it calls for considerate behaviour. It requires considerate behaviour primarily in that the realisation of these new mechanisms should not be viewed solely in terms of figures.

I therefore ask you to look for similarities in Member States over the course of your work instead of seeking to separate them into well-performing and less well-performing countries, and to look for the efforts to which all Member States committed themselves upon their accession. In this I wish you wisdom, patience and perseverance. I wish you success in steering the boat of the European Union over the upcoming six months.</literal>

As some of my friends told me, small countries can work miracles. So let us believe in this miracle. As usual the work of the Presidency is cut out. Why it is so difficult? Just a few reasons: we have to preserve the unity of Europe when the eurozone crisis is trying to tear us apart. We have to constantly fight against the extremists and the Eurosceptics, and let me underline that citizens are not happy about the European Union.

We are going to start to apply the ‘six-pack’ and take some painful decisions. There are serious doubts about the prevalence of democratic principles in some of the Member States, including a state I know well. However, I am not completely dejected. We have heard a coherent, elaborate Presidency programme for a responsible, dynamic green and safe Europe. As a mother of two, you place special attention on youth, as I do. I am, therefore, confident that the Commission will keep its determination to do this job, and make sure that our common European values are respected everywhere.

What is more, we finally have a country in the Presidency that is led by a woman, a Social Democratic woman. For all this I have high expectations. Thank you very much for your solidarity.</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like to congratulate you warmly and I look forward to working with you.

This Council Presidency is focusing on two main areas. It has set itself the goal of leading a responsible Europe. A responsible Europe must be a democratic Europe. If Europe is to be democratic, the European Parliament must be involved in every decision at a European level. During the Danish Presidency nothing must be decided without the participation of the European Parliament.

A responsible Europe must be united and not divided. Perhaps it is a good thing that you are not in the euro area, because there attempts are currently being made to separate some countries from the others. All the measures which are taken in response to the crisis must be community measures and must prepare for the next stage of integration, which involves establishing an economic and social union and a political union.

The second area which you will be focusing on is regulating the financial markets. I would like to ask you to work together with us in Parliament to overcome the individual interests quickly and to implement the necessary measures to improve capital structure and liquidity while preserving the structure of the European economy.

We have a great deal to do and we can only accomplish it together.</literal>

As a Swede, it is easy to be committed to – and also to be proud of – the Danish agenda, although it has a slight Social Democrat touch, but I think it is important to see the big challenge that the Danish Presidency is facing. At a time when we risk a division in Europe in the process of deciding how to achieve financial stability, it is very important that the Presidency be able do whatever is needed in order to take care of the entire European Union and to bind Member States together. The process of the internal market, and of launching a new wave of reform for the internal market, is one of the most important ways of binding Europe together, and also of regaining economic strength and dynamism.

It is, however, very important, at the same time, to pay attention to energy issues, which are playing an increasingly important role in geopolitics. Specifically, the development of a common European Union foreign policy on energy should be encouraged.

At the moment we have legislation that provides that in the European Union supply systems operators are separate from suppliers and from producers. At the same time we know that there are Member States that are concluding cooperation agreements with third countries which allocate exclusive rights to use the infrastructure, thus preventing competition and running counter to the interests of the European Union’s residents.

I urge the Presidency to stress the need for European Union legislation, which must be incorporated not only in agreements between European Union states, but also in those with third countries. Thank you for your attention.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that today we have heard three speeches that bode well for Europe. They represent three programmes and three strategies.

I would like to say to Ms Thorning-Schmidt that she has made a very important point, that Denmark follows Europe’s destiny. It is not just a throw-away line, it is a phrase that makes a commitment to strengthen Europe and to offer total support; to make sure, as she said at the end, that the Community method prevails.

We therefore find ourselves in a very difficult situation – and mine is not empty rhetoric – as we are facing a halt in the EU development process. This has been superseded not by amendment of the treaty, as some Members have claimed, but by an agreement between the intergovernmental Member States. We have come to a standstill and are facing very difficult times, which I do not believe will lead to the possibility of development. With the intergovernmental agreement there is neither growth nor development. Therefore the commitment of the Danish Presidency is to prevent all this from happening.</literal>

  Mr President, last Friday – 13 January 2012 – Standard and Poor’s told markets in the world that EU leaders had been incompetent in responding to the crisis. They have not stopped but rather they have fuelled speculation against the euro. S&amp;P stressed that EU systemic tensions and euro problems were due to the growing divergence of competitiveness among core EU Member States and the so-called ‘periphery’. Solidarity has been an empty word in measures to counter these structural imbalances.

The rating agencies have now come to agree with the progressive left that the punitive austerity obsessing Mrs Merkel’s government and other neo-liberal governments in Europe is not reducing debt anywhere but merely bringing recession, mass unemployment, fiscal and social injustice and rebellion to European streets.

A financial transaction tax is indeed a very good beginning but it is not enough. We absolutely need to move towards fiscal harmonisation. Take the case of Portugal, where 19 out of the 20 top stock-exchange-listed companies have moved fiscal domicile into the Netherlands and Luxembourg, not just to avoid paying higher taxes at home but to skip declaring the proceeds of investment in other world markets. How can they compete in this fiscal jungle in the EU?</literal>

  Mr President, I want first of all to welcome the priority to be given by the Danish Presidency to chronic diseases and specifically to diabetes. I applaud the input I believe my Danish Co-Chair of the Diabetes Working Group, Christel Schaldemose, has probably made to securing this commitment.

Diabetes is no longer a ticking bomb. The bomb has gone off and we are heading for 10% of our citizens having diabetes, with huge costs to our healthcare system. Please will the Danish Presidency help to secure an EU diabetes strategy?

In the remaining seconds I also want to repeat the question that Guy Verhofstadt put – and, hopefully, get an answer from the Prime Minister. What is the Council doing to call Hungary to account? There is a legal and constitutional crisis in Hungary which is a real threat to European values of liberal democracy. I hope we are going to get a change to the traditional diplomatic club in the Council, where none of the 27 call each other to account because of the ‘I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine’ culture.</literal>

  –Mr President, Prime Minister, Denmark is yet another country which, in taking over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, has announced that it will lead the Union out of the economic crisis and ensure economic growth. Only six months remain for this to be done. Let us remind ourselves that a similar priority was found in the programmes of the Belgian, Hungarian and Polish Presidencies, not to mention the Treaty of Lisbon.

All the citizens of the European Union have an interest in this objective being achieved at last. Looking however at the efforts of previous presidencies and the continued accumulation of economic problems we can be almost certain that the next presidency is going to have to include a similar priority in its agenda. The Danish Presidency is also going to tackle the budget for 2014-2020. So it is extremely important that it maintain the very important Cohesion Fund, thanks to which the Union’s new Member States from Central and Eastern Europe can develop. In the point about a green Europe, Denmark assumes, on the one hand, sustainable economic growth, and, on the other hand, still wants to push through EU climate packages. In the opinion of many experts, these two courses of action are mutually exclusive.</literal>

The Union institutions have clearly been replaced by informal governance which has not been a success.

Greece, Prime Minister, is proof of the failure of Europe’s economic policy, followed by Italy and all the other countries in the South.

  –Mr President, I would like to thank our Prime Minister, who made a splendid speech. That is something we can be proud of.

I have just one point that I would like to put to the Prime Minister. It concerns Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which relates to good administration. Citizens in Europe have been granted the right to good administration, and this in fact concerns the institutions here. Therefore it is something that should be taken seriously. However, if we do not have any proper legislation on good administration, the Commission will not employ it of its own free will. I have many reasons to believe that. Only if there is a push from a country holding the Presidency that for a long time has put transparency and citizen participation at the top of the agenda, only if there is a push from us will Article 41 be converted into good administration and there will be a chance that the Commission will take seriously the clear right that is now embodied in the Charter.

Therefore, I would strongly recommend that this matter also be taken up, because, although it might not be as glamorous as all the other matters, it is still very important.</literal>

There are 23 million companies in the European Union and 23 million people who are unemployed. Of course, when it is presented like this, the equation can certainly not be proven, but it shows that we must work together to give our citizens a taste for business, a taste for entrepreneurship.

In this regard, I should like to welcome the European Commission’s proposal on social entrepreneurship. This is a sector which will eventually represent a turnover of EUR 100 billion within the European Union, and account for 3% to 7.5% of the EU workforce. This proposal, Mr Barroso, is ambitious and timely, and I should hope that, together, Prime Minister, we can manage to adopt it in plenary during your Presidency.

  –Mr President, Prime Minister, thank you for presenting your programme.

During the last six months, Parliament adopted a report on the fight against poverty. All of us here today are aware that the phenomenon is becoming increasingly serious in Europe with the different austerity measures in place in various Member States, whereby the report stated that such measures cannot undermine employment and social protection.

In this context, what are the elements of the programme for your Presidency which will allow us to support Commissioner Andor in his efforts to meet the aim of reducing by 20 million the number of European people living in poverty?

In my view, the budget seems particularly important. The report recommends – and I quote – ‘pressing ahead with, and providing increased funding for, European programmes which can contribute to various aspects of the fight against social exclusion and poverty’. How do you see this recommendation being implemented through negotiations on the future Multiannual Financial Framework?

Two subjects in particular will also come to the table: the establishment of a programme of food aid for the most deprived beyond 2013 and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. What are the Presidency’s views on these programmes, which seem to have been placed in a precarious position by some Member States within the Council?</literal>

Indeed, a number of challenges await Denmark, which are particularly important for the future of the European Union. These include the practical implementation of the European project for a reinforced economic union and further negotiations on the EU’s new Multiannual Financial Framework (2014-2020). Pushing these negotiations forward will be a major challenge for Denmark. Given that 2012 is the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, I am delighted that Denmark intends to focus on increasing employment among older people. I welcome the fact that by discussing not just current but future employment problems, in its programme Denmark is talking not only about older people but also about the young and their preparation for future labour market needs. Particular attention is also paid to reducing early school leaving. It is nevertheless disappointing that the Presidency’s programme fails to mention issues of major importance to people such as the Maternity Leave and Anti-Discrimination Directives that have been deadlocked for over a year. I have already consulted the Danish Presidency about the future of both legal acts, and about when the Member States are planning to reach a common solution in order to adopt these important Directives as soon as possible, therefore it would be very interesting to hear what specific actions the Presidency intends to take regarding these two issues.</literal>

Moreover, this has been one of the blows struck by the Treaty of Lisbon to the – never realised – principle of equality between the Member States of this EU. The programme of the Danish Presidency, as were the work of previous presidencies, is illustrative of who is in charge of the EU and determines its course: the Franco-German directorate, ever more dominated by Germany, which always acts in defence of its major companies and financial institutions. This is clear from reading this Presidency’s priorities, which include deepening the internal market by moving it into areas like public procurement, energy and knowledge, with the express intention of turning knowledge into a business; the deregulation and liberalisation of international trade; the participation of older people in the labour market; and, of course, so-called austerity, in relation to which quick implementation of the decisions included in so-called economic governance, the Euro Plus Pact, and the most recent intergovernmental treaty – which seeks to enshrine austerity in constitutions and constitutes a dangerous attack on democracy – are advocated. These are policies of continuing with what has brought us to economic and social disaster; the splashes of green and socialism that the new Danish Government of the Social Democrats is seeking to give the programme are not enough to conceal them.</literal>

               Looking at the text of the Danish Presidency programme, I think it will be of high quality and has the capacity to succeed. Denmark is giving up its role as chair of the euro area stabilisation negotiations. On the one hand, this is understandable—it is not a member of the monetary union. Modesty on the part of the Danish representatives may, however, be unnecessary. The situation in the euro area affects the whole of Europe, and a neutral moderator of the negotiations would certainly be no bad thing. We must accept the decision, however, and focus on equally important points such as the efforts to restore economic growth and create jobs. I must nevertheless say that I was not pleased by all of the points in the Presidency programme. Although the text of the programme does not mention the financial transaction tax, the Danish minister for the economy has already stated that she does not support the tax. This is an especially unfortunate decision. Now is the time to take an unambiguous position in the area of regulation of the financial sector. Now is the time to make it clear who is responsible for the crisis and who is avoiding contributing to its costs. If, in the Presidency programme, there is a chapter ‘Responsible Europe’ with a subheading ‘Strengthened financial regulation and supervision’ but such an important proposal is missing, then it does not seem to me to be particularly credible. Despite that, I will keep my fingers crossed that my Danish colleagues see through this difficult period for the EU with honour.</literal>

I noted with satisfaction that besides short-term crisis management measures the development of a green economy and the implementation of a single energy market continue to be among the most important objectives. I hope that based on Denmark’s experience and expertise we will see significant progress in both areas over the course of the Presidency. One of the most significant reports of these six months will concern the Energy Efficiency Directive. An early conclusion of this matter is in the interest of us all. However, true success will only be achieved if the Directive sets out solutions that work in real life as well. High-sounding objectives have thus far often turned out to be failures.

Allow me to also make a few remarks in my own field of expertise, which includes industry, research and energy. I have to agree with the position that we must work on creating a more effective internal energy policy which would result in intensified competition between supply companies, which in turn would reduce consumer prices. Furthermore, it is important for the EU to not be completely vulnerable to countries with immense raw material reserves.

The crisis concerns not just the budgetary situation of the Member States, but is above all about the identity of the EU. We are facing a period in which the future of the united Europe will be decided. It is becoming increasingly evident that the new international agreement on strengthening economic union which is in preparation may lead not just to a deepening of the divide between the euro area and the other countries, but also to a weakening of the EU institutions. Therefore, the Danish Presidency should concentrate above all on defending the cohesion of the Union, its character as a community and the principles of solidarity. The fact that Copenhagen does not intend to adopt the common currency in the immediate future may be seen to be worrying. Furthermore, the previous government was a supporter of reducing the EU budget. However, I hope this will not affect the stance of our Danish friends. I am an optimist and I believe that during the Presidency they will be able to represent the interests of all the Member States. My optimism is based primarily on the memory of how superbly they coped with finalisation of the accession negotiations before what is known as the great enlargement. It seems, therefore, that at such a difficult moment the responsibility of holding the Presidency of the Council could not have fallen to a more suitable country. It is well known not only for its openness to the arguments of the other side and a culture of compromise, but also for its ability to make use of these qualities in practice.</literal>

However, one expects a vision of the increasing role of the EU macro regional strategies, such as the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR). The Polish presidency has been active on this issue and its input requires continuation. The EUSBSR is a unique opportunity to implement plans for stronger Europe, concretely in the Baltic Sea region which is a dynamic area and least affected by current euro crisis. We expect from the Danish presidency a clear agenda and better coordination of the EUSBSR projects presented by eight member states around the Baltic Sea. I welcome Danish emphasis on creating a genuine digital single market. To boost cross-border business making, especially in e-commerce, one has to reduce decisively legislative and administrative barriers. This is a must if the EU is serious about reviving its economies and restoring its competitiveness on global markets. Lastly, cyber security is not once mentioned in the Danish programme.

Europe needs to ensure economic growth and the creation of jobs as a necessary addition to the economic governance and the financial regulation. Without them, the European will lag behind in terms of global competition.

One of the basic principles of the single market is the removal of restrictions on the free movement of workers from EU member states. We cannot have a genuine single market without these restrictions removed. Therefore, further steps in this respect are very important in the next period. The recent positive decision taken in this respect by Italy is most welcome but the Member States which are still maintaining some restrictions need also to be convinced.

I believe that the Danish pragmatic approach will help in achieving progress related to the removal of restrictions on the free movement of all EU workers.</literal>

I have noticed that a different approach was adopted during the last conciliation proceedings for the annual budgets: the resources were determined and then distributed in a fairly random manner. I have understood that your proposal for tackling these negotiations is to go round gathering views on the size of national contributions at the end of January and to come back again to the proposals for the budgetary chapters, including for European policies, only in the course of the month. Although we are going through a financial crisis at the moment, I believe that this approach is not beneficial to the EU.

Please do not forget that the Commission’s proposals on own resources must also be discussed in parallel. A possible agreement on own resources would ease the tension on the size of the national contribution.</literal>

               . –Denmark is taking over the Presidency of the European Union in difficult circumstances. In order to ensure solidarity and growth, the Danish Government will have to cooperate not only with Member States and EU institutions, but also with civil society. I welcome that the areas being dealt with by the Danish Presidency are crucial to the future of the EU as a whole: economic recovery and budgetary discipline, energy efficiency and job creation in a competitive economy and a secure, powerful Europe are very much areas that can kick-start the European project. Economic measures are essential to restoring citizens’ confidence in the European Union.

However, as a Romanian, I am going to mention a particular theme of the Presidency of the Council, specifically the Schengen system. As President Barroso also said, total respect for the right of free movement in the EU is a priority. Given the delays in making a decision, I call on Denmark to find a solution for admitting Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area this spring. The experts have reiterated their conclusions that both states have fulfilled all the technical criteria for accession. I believe that we all agree that the EU must not introduce double standards for old and new Member States. This would have a profound impact on citizens’ confidence in EU integration.</literal>

               . –Denmark, a country which is critical both of the euro and of Europe, is now taking the helm. At the EU Summit in December, Denmark was accused by the French President of being an outsider and a new, small Member State. It is clear that this Council Presidency, in the same way as its recent predecessors, will be overshadowed by the debt crisis. In this situation, healthy criticism of Europe may well be just the right approach to enable mediation between the euro countries and the non-euro countries and to allow the necessary steps, including the introduction of a core European monetary agreement, to be taken. We must hope that the scepticism shown by Denmark with regard to the removal of border controls when the Schengen Agreement was extended will result in the Commission not making the imposition of border controls more difficult without good reason and, therefore, not further restricting national sovereignty. When it comes to making the decision on Serbian accession status at the EU Summit in March, hopefully Denmark will abolish the double standards that have been in place until now and introduce fair treatment for Serbia. Ultimately, it is totally inappropriate for the EU to demand that Serbia recognises Kosovo when not all of its own Member States have done so. In addition, it is high time that the negotiations with Turkey on EU accession are turned into negotiations on a privileged partnership.</literal>

The Danish Presidency will also see the start of the in-depth debates on the future common agricultural policy, on which note I would like to make a few comments on the programme presented.

Food scarcity is a real problem. The trend for falling food prices has ended. The period of abundance is also over, and we are now faced with shortages. Many of the agricultural priorities are important and welcome. However, we need to find the most appropriate correlation between these objectives and the need to increase productivity. We cannot tinker with the stability of the population’s food supply. Denmark ought to wish the CAP reform success, as well as Romania’s farmers, given that Danish investors own more than 1.4% of agricultural land in Romania, having purchased roughly 130 000 hectares of it in recent years.</literal>

The people of Denmark have spoken out clearly against joining the euro area in two referendums. Copenhagen has shown that economic survival without the euro is possible and that not all critics of the euro area are automatically enemies of Europe. Its opposition to Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area was a sovereign decision on behalf of its own population. The EU could benefit from this approach. However, what do we have to fear? As a non-member of the euro area, Copenhagen will not be able to do much about the euro crisis. Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy will continue to go it alone and to push through their own ideas. In addition, many people want to make more progress in the accession negotiations with Turkey. Prime Minister Erdoğan, with his tough-talking, nationalist approach and his anti-Western and anti-Israeli attitude, has demonstrated himself that Turkey does not share common European values.</literal>

First of all, Denmark has an important role to play as a bridge between members of the euro area and the other EU Member States, or to borrow the inspired expression used by Nicolai Wammen, a ‘bridge over troubled waters’.

We are in obvious need of unity to ensure not only Europe’s economic future, but also the political viability of the European project. Secondly, as has been emphasised by representatives of the Danish Government on different occasions, Denmark regards the freedom of movement as one of the EU’s major achievements. The intention announced recently by the Danish authorities to work towards removing the political obstacles hampering Romania and Bulgaria from joining the Schengen area must be welcomed. I therefore hope that the Danish Presidency will give vital impetus to the expansion of the Schengen area and that this will apply as soon as possible with regard to Romania and Bulgaria.

Lastly, I wish to welcome the fact that EU enlargement in general is a priority for the Danish Presidency. This sends out a very positive signal to Europe’s partners, especially at a time of crisis.</literal>

               The Danish Presidency promises to be a difficult time. It is already encountering challenges simply on account of the turbulent recession and economic crisis in Europe. During its Presidency, Denmark is keen to be seen as the prime mover in a greener future for European energy. This is an important issue. Unfortunately, Denmark will probably hit a reef early on during its maiden voyage. Policy and the public will inevitably set their sights on remedying the economic situation. Denmark, as a country with an opt-out from the euro, will be in an awkward situation when there are debates on subjects such as citizenship, defence policy or legal and internal affairs. Denmark is not involved in such discussions.

We left the year 2011 with no solution to the economic crisis. Furthermore, an even more serious political crisis started. A stable economic union now has to be established outside the EU, with no right of initiative on the part of the Commission or democratic control on the part of the European Parliament. There is nothing wrong with the programme for the Danish Presidency. Its four priorities for sustainable growth are aimed at a more responsible, more dynamic, greener and safer Europe. I am sincerely optimistic about 2012, and I wish Denmark luck in its Presidency.</literal>

               –The year 2012, which brings with it the Danish Presidency, is European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations. I am pleased that in connection with this the Presidency is planning numerous initiatives in this area. According to UN forecasts, the proportion of people aged over 65 in Europe will be 23.8% by 2030. In Poland it is anticipated that by 2060 for every three people in work there will be two people who are in retirement, and that the number of people over 80 will rise four- or fivefold.

The problem of an ageing society is to a large extent being recognised as a challenge which must be faced by the entire European Union. We urgently need an effective European demographic policy with particular emphasis on economic and health issues. I hope that the Danish Presidency, as part of the Europe 2020 strategy, will support gender equality in accordance with the strategy of the Commission on this matter and with an adapted European Pact for Gender Equality. I call for completion of work on the proposal for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on women in sport and the author of a written declaration on amateur sport, I would like to highlight promotion of participation in physical activity to support an improvement in the health and quality of life of the EU’s citizens.</literal>

We do believe, however, that the efficient and constructive Danish administration, which is experienced in managing Europe, will cope with the coordination of anti-crisis measures. However, we are also aware that as was the case with Poland, the fact that Denmark is not a member of the euro area may prove to be a hindrance. An equally important challenge facing the Danish Presidency is the need to agree key elements of the future budgetary framework for 2014-2020. There is no doubt that the negotiations will be very difficult. Our expectation is that Denmark will be able to find a compromise among the Member States which guarantees provision of funding at the appropriate level for every EU policy. I believe that the words being repeated by Danish politicians – a budget for the future – mean focussing the budget on meeting new challenges in particular areas, and not a radical redistribution or cuts. Personally, I am convinced that Denmark will manage to confront the challenges and fulfil the expectations we are placing in her. It should be reiterated that it was in fact during the Danish Presidency in the second half of 2002 that it was possible to complete the difficult accession negotiations with the group of 10 states of the New Europe, including Poland. I hope that today Denmark is capable of achieving similar successes in the area of budget negotiations and the fight against the debt crisis.</literal>

I want to draw particular attention to the situation of women, among whom the level of employment is still low and is in danger of falling even lower; to the situation of young people, who after completing their education remain without work for too long; to the situation of disabled people and to the employment situation of people over the age of 50. Regardless of savings, money and appropriate programmes must be found for the creation of new jobs. I wish you success in achieving the objectives you have adopted.</literal>

Even if not all of us use the euro as our currency, its fate is our common responsibility. It is vital for all Member States that we find a way out of the current situation. We must not differentiate between individual countries in this respect.

Economic, ecological, demographic, employment and other problems. Responsibility of Member States for their economies and budgets is priority number one, but it is also crucial for the fulfilment of other priorities. At present, however, cooperation within the EU institutional triangle, that is to say the Commission, Parliament and the Council, must be a priority if we want to address the problems of the European Union. However, experience so far shows a mutual non-acceptance. Typically, the Commission and Parliament will agree, but the Council will say no, because the individual representatives of the Member States first defend their own national interests, and then common, Europe-wide interests. Denmark therefore faces a big challenge, to try to achieve what its predecessors have failed to. That is, the mutual respect and cooperation of all Member States and European institutions to the benefit of all citizens.</literal>

Given that 2012 is the ‘European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between the Generations’, I welcome the initiative by the Danish Presidency to encourage older people to join the labour market. The call for increased gender equality will also have a positive impact on labour markets throughout Europe. This is something that is urgently needed, in particular in the light of the demographic change which is underway in Europe. The younger generation has also not been forgotten. The focus will be on young people who leave the education system too early. The European Parliament has shown what it can do in this respect. During the negotiations on the so-called six-pack, we ensured that collective bargaining autonomy was protected as part of all the measures involved. The European Parliament will take this approach in many areas in future. We finally need to solve the problem of fiscal policy. Also, the regulation of the financial markets must remain high on the agenda. The European Parliament will work together with the Danish Presidency under the leadership of the social democratic Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt to resolve these issues.</literal>

It is our duty to give today’s young people the chance to enjoy education and health-care systems of the same quality, as well as the opportunity to contribute to the development of society, just like previous generations. In many European states hospitals and schools are being closed, the employment rate has declined alarmingly, and people are anxious about their future.

On the basis of these, the Danish Government is intending to solve the current economic crisis by working towards sustainable economic growth capable of creating jobs and wealth in the European continent; towards a Europe that is disciplined in financial terms, that exploits its full economic potential and that makes renewable energy central to the debate; towards a Europe that is, above all, safe for Europeans. We can make out on the horizon that its task will not be easy, but the ambition of this programme demonstrates the commitment of this Member State that, while it is not in the euro area, is emphasising its commitment to the future intergovernmental agreement, which is key if short-, medium- and long-term measures for combating the sovereign debt crisis are to be established. As such, in the committees of which I am member, I should like to emphasise the objective of continuing with the reforms to cohesion policy and the high priority given to the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 and, in the area of transport, the reference to the Connecting Europe Facility as an engine for realising a true single market.</literal>

Only by strengthening cooperation in a spirit of solidarity can we build a single, truly common, effective and innovative market, which will be able to maintain its global position not just for several years, but for several decades. However, this requires choosing a difficult route and setting ourselves ambitious political, economic and social objectives, which none of the Member States can achieve on their own. This enormous effort must be made at all levels, from the teaching and development of children and young people, through social organisations and businesses and all the people involved in their operation, to people and organisations working in the international arena, because only in this way can we be effective in working together to give permanent strength to the foundations of the European Union.</literal>

Their ambition is to be consistent and implement the measures agreed by the Council and subsequently this Parliament. Citizens want coordination, however, not centralisation. That is why I warmly welcome the fact that the Danish Presidency of the Council rejects the introduction of a European tax on financial transactions. Citizens consider the second major priority to be tackling poverty and social exclusion. Here, Denmark could build on the results of the Hungarian Presidency in the social sphere and the promotion of solidarity between the generations. Improving conditions for the family, which forms the basic social network, should be one of the top priorities of European countries during a crisis. Paradoxically, however, it was during the European Year of Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations that the family ceased to be a political priority.</literal>

               –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be good if Ms Tymoshenko were not in prison and I could speak to her on the phone.

Mr President, I would like to thank you and your predecessor and also the group chairs for the restraint that has been shown so far during the negotiations. It is obvious that some members of the Council have not taken a particularly friendly approach during all the phases. However, we have the impression, after the most recent session last Thursday and on the basis of what we have heard, that things could be moving in the right direction. Nevertheless, in the light of the previous period it is, of course, difficult for us to believe that this will be the case and, therefore, we are waiting for the next draft, which should be ready tomorrow.

I would like to make it clear on behalf of my group and I believe also on behalf of the two Members who will be speaking next that this agreement is not our first choice. It would be better if everything had been included in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) from the start. My second point is that this agreement must not result in a divided Europe. For this reason, it must be drafted in such a way that the 26 countries that want to be involved can be involved. My third point is that the rights of the European Parliament and the European Union institutions must be protected and that any implementation which is transferred into legislation must follow the regulations of the TFEU and the ordinary legislative procedure, so that we do not end up with two legal bases within the European Union.

Ladies and gentlemen, we must make it clear that austerity measures alone will not resolve the problems. Growth and structural change are needed as well. This is also the position of the European Parliament.

Finally, I would like to say that we must follow the rules in Protocol 1 of the Treaty concerning cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament. We have a joint obligation in this area which we must fulfil on the basis of common rules. As the agreement will rightly expire in five years at the latest and will be transferred into the TFEU – the position of the European Parliament on this has been accepted – we should ensure that there will be no new institutions which make this transfer process more difficult. The European Union institutions are the only valid ones. All the parties to the agreement which are in the euro, which want to join the euro and which will be joining the euro must be present at the Euro Summit. We do not want any divisions here. All 26 Member States must have the same rights. We want a unified Europe.</literal>

               –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Brok reminded us, this Parliament has adopted a critical approach to the new international agreement, which is reflected in the resolution we are about to approve.

We have given the reasons for our criticism on several occasions. At an institutional level we believe that the tools provided by the treaties would have made it possible to avoid the damage of an intergovernmental agreement and to strengthen governance and budgetary discipline in the euro area whilst remaining within the legal framework of the EU. It is a paradox that even before the ink on the ‘six-pack’ has dried, some Member States already want to amend it by intergovernmental means, introducing some elements that they had not asked for before, indeed in some cases that they had actually opposed. This is a step backwards and not forwards along the road to fiscal union.

On a political level we believe the economic slant of this agreement is dangerously unilateral, because without concrete measures to strengthen growth and solidarity the EU will not emerge from the crisis and the very objective of stability will not be achieved. We nevertheless felt that we had a duty to become active and constructively involved in limiting the damage to the edifice of the EU, defending the primacy of the Community method and Parliament’s prerogatives, and emphasising the necessity and urgency of shared management of sovereign debt.

It is extremely significant from a political point of view that the four pro-European groups have defined a shared platform of amendments along these lines.

Now we are waiting for the fourth draft of the agreement. It is clear that if not even the smallest points, on which there was agreement, are faithfully carried over into the text, Parliament will have recourse to all the tools at its disposal in order to oppose the agreement. However it is also clear that only a significant correction in approach, on an institutional and economic level, will be able to eliminate the reasons for our criticism and our determination to build a real European economic government based on the Community method and focusing on stability, growth and solidarity.</literal>

               Mr President, what we are doing is a very dangerous exercise. We are working on this treaty and my fear is that it could be used in future by the Council and the Member States as a way of tackling a number of problems outside the, outside the secondary legislation and outside the normal Treaty provisions. We agreed with the negotiators – and this is also reflected in today’s resolution – to limit everything as much as possible to the so-called ‘golden rule’. If we go beyond that then we are in fact destroying the Community method.

We have three objectives. First of all there must be no double standards; we cannot accept that in the future in Europe. The Stability Pact is based on the Treaty and the secondary legislation, but the stability and growth policy is based on this treaty. This is unacceptable. There has to be one standard in the European Union and the eurozone, not two.

The same applies to the excessive deficit procedure. In future, if we are not able to amend this treaty, there will be two types of excessive deficit procedure: one on the deficit criterion and another with other rules on the debt criterion. Again double standards, that is my big fear.

Secondly, we have to have a binding provision in the treaty that this new treaty must comply with the provisions of existing treaties within at least five years, if possible within three. This must be a binding provision for the contracting parties.

Finally, we have to secure the role of the European Parliament so that Parliament and the President of the Parliament are able to participate in euro summits. These are informal summits and, as such, Parliament must be represented at them. Having said that, I am not sure that if we improve the treaty we can back the treaty. That is another discussion and another decision which we will have to take in the coming weeks.</literal>

I should like to say two things about this treaty. Firstly, it is completely useless. We do not need this treaty. This is not a treaty; it is an intergovernmental agreement which is only there, according to those who invented it, to reassure the markets by demanding the integration into national constitutions of what is called the debt brake or the golden rule into national legislation.

All of the markets tell us that they are not interested anyway. We are therefore in the middle of establishing an intergovernmental agreement which does not interest the markets today because they want a policy design of the European economy for tomorrow. This treaty will not guarantee this policy design.

We are asking the Member States who sign this treaty to say, for example, that we need a road map for the Commission on a tax on financial transactions. We are asking for a road map on redemption funds, on Eurobonds. We will not have this in the treaty. In the opinion of our group, with this agreement – you see, I always say ‘treaty’ although it is an agreement –, we are wasting time by trying to improve something which is useless anyway. We are intelligent, we will improve it, but this is not the necessary response to the financial and economic crisis that Europe is currently experiencing.

Parliament needs to be clear. If it does not take legislative initiatives to ask that what needs to be done is done, it will not itself be doing what must be done to avert the crisis today.</literal>

               Mr President, I am sorry to have to admit it but I think I partly agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit for a change!

Not on all of what he said, obviously, but certainly the bit about the uselessness of this treaty because, while it might well succeed in solving the next crisis – and it may well have prevented this crisis if it had been part of the original Treaty on Monetary Union – it was not and is not going to do anything to solve the immediate difficulties. What is worse, if anything, is that the European Council diverted valuable political energy and resources away from facing the reality of the crisis. In the aftermath, what we have seen from many quarters is an attempt to make scapegoats out of those who neither caused the problem nor have the power to implement a solution. Perhaps this is in order to distract attention from the glaring failure of the summit.

I also agree completely with the Finnish Foreign Minister who said earlier this week that this whole contract is at best unnecessary and at worse harmful, and that Finland has reason to oppose the entire treaty. Congratulations to him for speaking the truth for a change.

But furthermore, let me say a word about the attacks that we have seen in this Parliament, and from the Commission, on the ratings agency. It is a little bit like blaming the weather forecasters for the rain in Brussels – and when the Commission announces that it intends not to tackle the problem but rather to regulate the way in which it is reported, then I know we really are in serious trouble!

Let us speak plainly, because the recommended medicine for many of the eurozone members at the heart of the crisis will kill the patient long before it can possibly achieve a cure. They are being asked to make ultimately futile gestures, and not to pursue serious solutions, because their debts in many cases are simply unsustainable and their fundamental uncompetitiveness is not being addressed by any of these measures. The obligations of continued eurozone membership are strangling the prospects of economic growth for a generation.

In the medium term they need substantial economic reform; in the short term, frankly, they need devaluation. The proponents of this treaty are, in my view, deluding themselves and attempting to delude the rest of us.</literal>

               . –Mr President, the plan is for the European Council to adopt this international treaty that we are debating today on 29 January. It will probably succeed, too. It will probably succeed in getting in adopted. On the other hand, it will not succeed in achieving the goal of the treaty, namely to ensure stability with regard to the euro. It will certainly not succeed in overcoming the crisis that the EU is currently experiencing. This treaty will damage Europe. It is the wrong medicine and the wrong method. It is the wrong medicine because we will obviously not create growth and prosperity by making cuts and savings. It will merely lead to a deeper crisis and more unemployment. If you do not believe us when we say this, you can ask Standard &amp; Poor’s, for example. However, it is also the wrong method, because yet again it will increase integration in the EU without asking the people. Even the European Parliament has not had any real influence – even though we have been allowed to appoint three or four people to take part in the discussions. Ordinarily, we are the ones who, on paper, should represent the citizens of the EU.

What then will be the certain result of this method? It will be an increase in our detachment from the people. If we want to change the architecture of the EU then there is only one democratic way to do that and that is by convening a convention in which it is possible for different opinions to come through. It is with regret that we find that the Heads of State or Government in the EU have chosen a different way. Therefore, on behalf of my group, let me say that the adoption of this treaty will not be supported by us.</literal>

               Mr President, there is a very bad case of denial in this Chamber this morning, a total refusal to accept that the euro project is failing. Greece is on the verge of a default. The bail-out fund is creaking. The credibility of the European Central Bank itself is now being called into question. It is all on the verge of going belly-up, and yet when the credit rating agencies tell the truth you try and pretend it is not happening. In fact Mr Brok and others were suggesting that it is all some dastardly plot by the Americans, the British and the Anglo Saxon markets to bring down the euro. The agencies are nothing more than the canary in the mine. They are telling you the truth, so please listen to Standard and Poor’s when they say that austerity alone will not work. You are driving these countries into depression just to save your euro project.

But I must acknowledge that you have lost absolutely nothing when it comes to your powers of deception. No, that is still very much on course. It was Nick Clegg who gave us the clue – a man who, I suspect, is rather more popular here than he is back home these days. Clegg was asked whether there should be a referendum on the forthcoming treaty. He said there was no need for that because it was all going to be ‘folded into’ the existing treaties. I thought, ‘What the dickens is he talking about?’ Well, now I have learnt. Mr Cohn-Bendit made it clear: it is to be the ‘Community method’. It is to be legislation where you know you have a majority in this Parliament and you know, under qualified majority in the Council, you can get everything through.

Why are you doing it this way? It is simple, is it not? – it is to avoid referendums. Because you know that if a treaty was put to Ireland and many other countries, the answer would be ‘no’. The peoples of Europe do not want this sado-monetarist package. The peoples of Europe, particularly in the case of the South, need to get out of the euro, to have devaluation and a chance to re-establish themselves again. You are denying them that chance and, by pushing the ‘Community method’, you are destroying democracy in Europe. I hope you are all very proud of yourselves.</literal>

  –Mr President, at the most recent summit on the crisis in the monetary union, the Heads of State or Government obviously agreed that the crisis represented an opportunity to turn the monetary union into what was allegedly intended by the founders of the euro when they introduced the common currency, in other words, a fiscal and economic union.

However, the precursor to this, the European semester, which involves Brussels monitoring the national budgets, is likely to degenerate very quickly into what is simply a bureaucratic method of planning that lacks any real content and merely pays lip service to the idea. In the light of the current crisis, it may be necessary to put in place strong leadership in Europe. However, this must not result in the Germans and the French taking control.

It is important that we comply with the EU Treaties. This means in particular that we must also protect the rights of the smaller Member States. They must not be crushed by the centralist juggernaut in Brussels and they must not be pushed to the wall by the large Member States in the EU.

Instead of constantly transferring authority to Brussels and moving ahead with EU centralisation, which has itself contributed to the debt crisis, we must finally learn the right lessons from the crisis.

Instead of more centralisation and more centralism, we need to return to an association of states with equal rights which can follow their own economic and budgetary policies. We must take a new approach and this is why we may have to put on the agenda the division of the euro area and the establishment of a core hard monetary union. Otherwise, we undoubtedly run the risk of the healthy national economies in the euro area being affected by the debt crisis.</literal>

               I do not support the motion for a resolution on the draft agreement, because it refers to evolution towards an economic and budgetary union. While agreements are necessary to greatly increase the competitive ethos of weak Member States, talking of an economic and budgetary union is taking things a step further. In addition, the European Parliament has called for a roadmap for Eurobonds. I can support that even less. This reduces the incentive for budgetary discipline, because it allows countries in difficulty to continue financing themselves at too low an interest rate. In Greece, interest rates that are too low have contributed to an influx of money which has proved impossible to repay, because of a lack of competitive ethos. That is why I am not in favour of the Eurobond. Moreover, it would be very expensive for countries that are currently able to lend at a low rate because of their strong budgetary discipline.

Incidentally, I welcome the new agreement which is intended to help strengthen budgetary discipline. This is a step in the right direction, for two reasons: in their national laws, participating countries will commit themselves to balancing their budgets or producing a surplus and, eventually, the discipline will be tightened, thanks to a standard of 0.5% of gross domestic product for the budget deficit in the medium term.</literal>

We do not need a new treaty, especially not this one. Let us use the one we have. Of course, we must concentrate on debt but we must go beyond budgetary austerity: in a previous resolution, Parliament asked for a road map including a plan for growth, investment and employment to be put in place. This is what we should work towards. Unfortunately, Parliament was not taken into consideration in these negotiations. What legitimacy would an agreement negotiated during this period of deep crisis for the EU have without full collaboration with the European Parliament and also the national parliaments?</literal>

               −I voted against the joint motion for a resolution on the conclusions of the Council at the beginning of January because the essential vision of the text reflects a pro-European stance that embraces the Community method, which is, however, largely responsible for the current crisis. The Community method means a gradual and progressive centralisation of powers in Brussels; it means taking increasingly important and invasive decisions passing over people’s heads; and it means less democracy, given the composition of the Commission in particular, a non-elected body made up of high-level bureaucrats who every day take decisions affecting the lives of half a billion people in Europe. Today we do not need more Europe, we need a Europe that is more flexible, more democratic and closer to the people, exactly the opposite of what we read in this resolution.</literal>

               –The planned fiscal agreement (treaty) decided on at the last Council meeting comprises a mixture of proposals which attempt to resolve a crisis triggered by the lack of some of the measures proposed prior to its occurrence. Unfortunately, the provisions on containing public deficits are not strong enough to resolve the current crisis which is evident through an increased lack of confidence in the bonds issued by EU Member States. I think that this stalemate can only by overcome by measures for stimulating economic growth, targeted primarily at SMEs (for instance, by partially subsidising the interest levied on bank loans). An excessive public deficit must obviously be avoided. However, any new deviation is unrealistic, which makes me think what good these constraints are now.

Otherwise, I believe that Member States must retain total control over their tax rate and that competition between them in this area cannot be damaging, just as competition between companies benefits consumers. On the subject of a financial transaction tax, the example of Hungary speaks for itself regarding the impact: a fall in capital exposure to this country and a reduction in lending activity, which is also expected to be the impact across the whole EU, albeit perhaps at a slower rate than in Hungary’s case.</literal>

What is actually needed is sound governance of the euro area and a greater degree of budgetary discipline at Member State level. However, I am not aware whether, in its current form, the intergovernmental agreement addresses this essential requirement. I have some reservations regarding this new treaty which risks duplicating regulations and creating a split between the euro area and the remaining Member States without actually being needed at all. The structural deficit criterion of 0.5% of GDP can be included very well in the Stability and Growth Pact which is directly applicable in Member States. On the other hand, to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the decisions implementing the agreement’s provisions, the ideal solution would be for them to be adopted using the Community method, thereby remaining consistent with existing European law. Last but not least, I think that the provisions concerning fiscal union are vague at the moment and that too much emphasis is placed on austerity without offsetting this with some measures aimed at stimulating economic recovery and returning to economic growth, which is needed so much in order to defuse social tensions.</literal>

I voted against today’s joint resolution by the political parties (Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance). Despite the fact that it expresses doubts about the need for the Treaty, the resolution avoids highlighting its basic drawbacks and criticising the policies being applied at European level. The ‘Treaty’ basically institutionalises austerity policies, reduces the quality of life for the majority of European citizens, increases inequalities between the Member States and creates a multi-speed Europe. Its main concern is fiscal prudence at any cost (for example wage, pension and benefit cuts), without in any way limiting the catastrophic profiteering of financial markets and credit rating agencies. Furthermore, the provisions of the ‘Treaty’ undermine the democratic rights of Europeans by minimising their facility to exercise an alternative economic and fiscal policy via their elected governments. The GUE/NGL Group highlighted the above issues and the need for extensive public consultation (for example referenda) on possible changes in an alternative motion for a resolution.</literal>

This stance is a good demonstration of the relevance of the resolution’s content, as well as of the extreme importance of the issues tackled. This is, firstly, because of the importance given to absolute respect for democratic accountability by ‘strengthening the involvement of both the European Parliament and the national parliaments, at their respective levels, in all aspects of European economic coordination and governance’, as can be read in the resolution and, obviously, in the European Treaties. It is also, however, because of the focus given to ‘a Union of both stability and sustainable growth’; that is, it emphasises the need to promote, starting with the fiscal discipline that must be the indisputable foundation of the future agreement, measures whose purpose is growth that is sustainable over the long term. This will enable greater convergence between the Member States, make our economy more competitive and, obviously, create jobs. Finally, it is also because it introduces concrete measures, of which I would stress the issuing of project bonds, a financial transaction tax and a roadmap to stability.</literal>

As far as content is concerned, the draft intergovernmental treaty proposes ‘ever closer’ economic governance and semi-automatic sanctions for the Member States.

While affirming that it ‘fully respects the responsibilities of national parliaments’, the text marginalises the representatives of the people a little more, places the European Court of Justice above national constitutions and restricts States to running an externally defined economic policy (the policy of restraint and deflation).

Neither the lack of an optimum monetary area nor the overexposure of the European market to social and ecological dumping involving low-cost countries have been taken into account.

With a poor diagnosis of the crisis as well as ill-advised ways of recovering from it, the European economies will not have the freedom they need to rediscover dynamism and growth.</literal>

It did not arrive because, at bottom, this agreement mirrors everything already adopted in the economic governance package and offers absolutely nothing new; if anything, its failing is lack of ambition.

As such, I fully support the motion for a resolution adopted here today, and I would reiterate the urgent need to seek a solution based on the Community pillar, whether through the possibility of issuing joint debt, of creating a common bailout fund or of any other option that deals directly with the crisis in which we are mired.</literal>

The emphasis given to reservations about or disagreements with how the agreement was reached does not obscure the acceptance of its intolerable content. This is a veritable, through which the intention is to permanently enshrine in the constitutions of countries like Portugal the policies of outright rolling back of civilisation that have been implemented there.

It is enlightening that the objectives of the agreement are advocated immediately in the first item, with only the way in which they are to be achieved in doubt.

The Commission and this Parliament are essentially devoting themselves to their role as a mere adornment to the institutional architecture of the EU; as echo chambers for the guidelines emanating from those who are truly in charge: the Franco-German directorate, ever more dominated by Germany.</literal>

Under pressure from Germany, European leaders have agreed on a new treaty to tighten fiscal discipline in the euro area and deepen economic integration. These steps should help to solve the debt crisis. The form of the new treaty, agreed at the European summit, was vetoed by the United Kingdom, however, which sought concessions in exchange for supporting the changes to existing EU treaties. Bypassing the British veto, leading EU representatives, led by France and Germany, are promoting a new treaty outside the legal framework of the EU. The crisis in the monetary union is a result of macroeconomic imbalances. It was not caused by irresponsible management, and if we are insufficiently aware of this fact, then the recipes based on this logic will not work either, of course. France and Germany basically announced their own decision without consulting the standard methods or the other Member States. If the EU is to work on this principle, and if the Franco-German proposal is to be promoted from the institutional perspective, in my opinion in an absolutely undemocratic manner and contrary to the fundamental values of the Union, then the democratic legitimacy of the process is really questionable in this case. I firmly believe that if we sacrifice democracy in favour of the power games of the strongest European nations, it will literally be civilisation that loses.</literal>

The community method that so many in the European Parliament adore is a time-consuming process and not one that is well suited to resolving the current crisis. The Parliament is not only wrong about the process of this agreement, but also the content. The introduction of a financial transaction tax will do nothing to solve the current crisis. Indeed, the Commission’s own impact assessment demonstrates that its introduction will make all our constituents poorer.

According to the resolution, we need not only austerity measures, but also the promotion of economic growth, the levying of taxes on financial transactions, and bonds to alleviate the present shortage of funds.

The problem is not whether the new so-called ‘fiscal’ treaty is purely intergovernmental or whether it conforms to the Community method. It is another straightjacket for national policies, a new bar in the prison which the European Union is increasingly resembling. It is aimed at speeding up the process of keeping tabs on budgets, which already appears in the ‘six pack’, and sanctuarising it. Of course, it is also aimed at reassuring international finance, an objective which has become the be all and end all.

We know how much credibility your actions have with the small financial oligarchy which claims to rule the world: the loss of more than one ‘A’, States first, then all of the collectives, companies and entities which benefit from their guarantee. The banks’ refusal to respect their promise to help resolve the crisis, in spite of the EUR 500 billion placed at their disposal by Mr Draghi.

Given the profound nature of Europe’s current difficulties, comprehensive, concerted action at EU level is the only real cure. Better involving national parliaments and the European Parliament in these decisions could also help to improve the democratic accountability of these decisions and improve their credibility for citizens. The specific policy proposals that emerged from the summit are also disappointing. While fiscal discipline is a necessary part of a stable and sustainable economy, it cannot alone bring about a return to growth. The EU should pursue a holistic response focusing on reforging a stronger, better-integrated European Single Market through the removal of the many remaining ‘gaps’, which would both offer consumers better protection and improve competitiveness, thus fostering growth and job creation.</literal>

Parallel institutions should not be created that might give rise to competition between the EU-27 and the Member States that will be parties to this intergovernmental agreement. In view of the fact that many EU Member States, when joining the EU, undertook to introduce the euro and have not yet done so, an opportunity should be provided for these states to choose when the agreement shall be binding upon them, either after they have fully joined the euro area or earlier. In implementing the European Commission’s proposals for eliminating excessive budget deficits the principle of a voluntary commitment to comply with them should be retained, and support for them should not be mandatory.

               I voted in favour of this resolution. EU needs to find a solution to the euro zone problems and to implement measures ensuring full fiscal discipline in the future. This can effectively only be done through Community Method and acknowledging the primacy of EU law. Only this will guarantee the credibility of the actions and tangible results. I reiterate the EP call to the Council that the agreement must be in conformity with EU law, in particular as regards the figures in the Stability and Growth Pact, following EU legal procedures and excluding any double standards. Democratic accountability must be guaranteed by strengthening the involvement of both the European Parliament and the national parliaments, at their respective levels, in all aspects of European economic coordination and governance. The most important concern is not to split the EU 27. The non-euro zone members need to participate in the meetings of 17. The other need is to avoid as much as possible creation of new institutions and mechanisms. The third challenge is to promote parallel to financial discipline closer convergence and stronger competitiveness.</literal>

               I have voted for this resolution, not because I am enamoured of the content of the so-called six-pack (I voted against much of it) or because the euro is the way forward for all – it is not. I am supporting it because I want decision making on matters of direct interest to the EU to be taken within a clear legal framework and on a clear legal basis.

I regret the British Government’s refusal to support concerted EU action and thus assist a push towards this new arrangement. An intergovernmental agreement can inhabit a grey zone, out of clear parliamentary oversight. We need clear parliamentary oversight: from both the EP and national parliaments, and this resolution states that clearly. The proposed intergovernmental agreement also sees governments stepping back from decisions made a few weeks ago, and this does not increase confidence or legal certainty. As the resolution clearly states, we need investment, not just austerity. We need a change of direction – towards a different future, based on reducing the gap between rich and poor and on new investment to help us work within environmental limits. The intergovernmental agreement is a distraction and provides no real solutions.</literal>

The representatives who were directly elected by European citizens are being excluded from the current negotiations which are limited to the inner sanctum of governments and exclude national parliaments and the European Parliament. By taking on the appearance of a negotiation between States, the most democratic bodies are only being granted the role of approving what is already a done deal. This denial of democracy is even more intolerable as it puts the very future of the European project at stake, swapping European solidarity for calls for austerity from the European Central Bank and the Commission. The surveillance and sanctioning mechanisms provided for are a way of bringing States’ economic policy to heel, preventing them from restarting their economies through consumption and investment. The Union must, on the contrary, completely overhaul its economic foundations and move towards a new pact of social progress which puts human beings as its priority. A European Central Bank, at the service of the people, must be the instrument for this ambition by rewarding creators of wealth and public goods with investments in education, training, research, infrastructure and public services.</literal>

               This joint motion for a resolution by the right, the social democrats and the Greens signals their agreement with the basis of the draft international agreement currently under negotiation, which amounts to the imposition of a reinforced ‘balanced budget rule’. This rule compels States to keep their budgets balanced or in surplus, working to a reference structural deficit figure of approximately 0.5% of nominal GDP. It obliges them to carve this diktat into the stone of their national legislation, preferably their constitutions. It demands that they put automatic mechanisms in place to ‘correct’ their budgetary policies in line with the Commission’s guidelines.

Far from being concerned about such measures, the four groups who tabled this motion have confined themselves to insisting on their right to play a part in the process of creating the new agreement and incorporating it into EU law within five years. They are not even insisting on the people’s right to have their say on this latest turn of the ‘austerity’ screw through a referendum. I voted against.</literal>

Firstly, I do not agree with the doubts about the need for the treaty. Its main objectives – including that of incorporating the golden rule of balanced budgets in the domestic law of the Member States – could not be achieved within the framework of the EU Treaties.

Secondly, I completely agree that implementation of the new treaty at Union level should fall to the institutions themselves in line with the Community method. However, I cannot leave one side the constitutional problem resulting from using the EU institutions to implement a treaty that falls outside the Treaties that created them and by which not all the Member States are bound.

Thirdly, I entirely agree with the idea that the treaty should provide for a true ‘economic and fiscal union’, but I believe that, in addition to a redemption fund, project bonds, a financial transaction tax and a roadmap for stability bonds, mention should have been included of a minimum level of tax harmonisation, without which there can be no level playing field in the internal market.</literal>

Leaving aside the debate as to whether the Community method is preferable to the intergovernmental method, as indicated in this resolution, it would be more important to underline how the ‘EU method’ itself is failing miserably. In its best manifestation, the European Union and the euro should have been able to guarantee more prosperity and security for all, in a climate of reciprocal advantages. None of this has happened, and the benefits, which have been marginal, have been limited to a few Member States, first and foremost to Germany.

Therefore I appreciated and share the position of Mr Cameron, who at least defended the interests of his people, and did not accept once again having to submit to the decisions of the others, which always only benefit the same few. At such a delicate time Member States have a duty to defend their prerogatives and their specific natures, and therefore I do not believe the line emerging from this resolution is sustainable, as it seems to wish to persist along the path of strengthening the EU in the name of utopian ideals that, in actual fact, have turned out to be totally unachievable.</literal>

               –The current version of the draftraises many doubts of a legal nature, and these issues will determine how effectively the compact is enforced. Signing and ratifying the agreement in the form proposed will lead to the emergence of an alternative legal order, whose relation with European law in many areas remains undefined. Unresolved issues include those concerning the primacy of EU law, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the competences of the other European institutions. Another unresolved but important issue is the question of insufficient democratic legitimacy, because democratic legitimacy can be achieved only by greater involvement of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. From the point of view of economic governance, it should however be noted that most of the provisions of the proposed intergovernmental agreement can be put into effect more quickly and effectively by using the Community method and the Stability and Growth Pact, which was amended in December. The approach followed by the Community method also makes it possible for countries which are not part of the euro area to be included in the decision-making process, and this in turn allows the need for additional EU institutions to be avoided. In relation to this, notice should be taken of the European Parliament’s proposal that all parties to the agreement, including both present and future members of the euro area, should have the right to participate in Euro Group summits, because it should be remembered that the euro area does not operate on an opt-in basis, and the countries which do not belong to the euro area are the subject of what is only a temporary derogation. Inclusiveness in the process for making decisions on economic governance is therefore in the interest of all, because the majority of the Member States have committed themselves to join the euro area.</literal>

This is not the time to be entering a plea of non-admissibility in the interminable battle between the ‘bad intergovernmental method’ and ‘good federalism’. Any level of willingness is a positive thing. The agreement is so far-reaching that we will be losing a significant player in the process: the United Kingdom. Of course I am in favour of a strong European Parliament. We bear the weighty responsibility of representing half a billion people. However, let us not go beyond our remit. The issue on the table was to resolve the debt crisis affecting sovereign states. It is therefore up to the States alone to find a solution.

As such, it is crucial to find solutions that are able to restore market confidence and, at the same time, that safeguard the values, principles and institutional framework on which the European project is founded. From this perspective, it is important to recognise that the new treaty for stability, coordination and governance in the economic and monetary union – which should be agreed on 30 January and involve the leaders of all the Member States, with the exception of the United Kingdom – is far from the ideal solution, since it represents a strengthening of intergovernmentalism at the expense of the Community method. Whatever the case, it is important to maintain a constructive position here: the European Parliament should do everything to seek to deepen the Union framework of this treaty and to expand its scope so that, as well as budgetary discipline, it also covers an agenda for growth and for solidarity between the Member States.

               I am amazed at the efforts that are being made in the chambers and corridors of Brussels to modify the economic agreement that was so grandly launched at the summit in December. The agreement, however, is becoming totally meaningless as regards the current crisis. Its name has already been changed several times along the way.

I have to correct my fellow Member: Finland has not as yet adopted an official position on the economic agreement. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Tuomioja, and not Prime Minister Katainen, made his position known earlier in the week, and suggested that Finland should boycott the agreement. The biggest problem in Finland was seen to be that the agreement might clash with the constitution. Talks on the agreement, however, are still continuing. In the end, I do not believe that the United Kingdom will be the only Member State to remain outside the agreement.

It is certainly not the content of the agreement that presents the greatest problem. The content is a very welcome addition to the rules on finance and budgetary discipline that were agreed back in the 1990s, rules which not even the biggest countries in the EU have been able to, bothered to or wanted to keep to. The problem is the bypassing of the parliamentary system. Europe’s only directly elected institution, the European Parliament, has been completely ignored in the attempts to find a solution to the economic crisis. In my opinion, the European Parliament should not be disregarded. Perhaps, after this, we will be able to concentrate on the issue itself, that is, remedying the current economic situation and restoring the confidence of the public and the markets.</literal>

According to the resolution, the new agreement should acknowledge the primacy of EU law over its provisions, and all measures to implement the agreement should be taken in accordance with the relevant procedures provided for in the EU Treaties.

The agreement must be in conformity with EU law, in particular as regards the figures in the Stability and Growth Pact, and if contracting parties wish to commit to targets at variance with EU law, this must be done through the applicable EU legal procedures and must not give rise to double standards.

Democratic accountability must be guaranteed by strengthening parliamentary involvement in all aspects of European economic coordination and governance. Cooperation between national parliaments and the European Parliament must take place in a manner consistent with the EU Treaties.

The new agreement must enshrine, in legally binding form, a commitment by the contracting parties to take all necessary steps to ensure that the substance of the agreement is incorporated into the Treaty within five years.</literal>

As our Co-Chairman, Mr Cohn-Bendit, stated during the debate, I feel that the proposed intergovernmental agreement has created more questions than it answers in terms of responding to the euro crisis. The agreement is useless and is not needed for the EU to be equipped with tools to deal with the financial and sovereign debt crises, as the drafting process for this agreement and the markets’ response have underlined. The draft agreement, with its one-dimensional focus on fiscal contraction, fails to deliver a convincing economic response to the immediate crisis. We will only draw a line under this crisis through a comprehensive response. This means accompanying measures on fiscal restraint with measures to guarantee the long-term economic viability of the euro area and its members. More specifically, it implies providing an effective firewall in the short-run and introducing eurobonds, a financial transaction tax and a meaningful sustainable growth and employment strategy as soon as possible.</literal>

We should nonetheless take care not to create a two-track legal system, and to make sure we bring on board the States that have not yet adopted the euro.

Will this not weaken European Union integration? Secondly, critics point out that the fiscal compact duplicates many of the measures contained, for example, in the ‘six-pack’ and the Stability and Growth Pact. Will this fact not create confusion in the interpretation of certain acts of EU law? Thirdly, there is a risk that the compact will create divisions within the Union, the consequences of which are difficult to foresee. Very worrying aspects include plans not to allow participation in Eurosummit meetings by countries which have announced a desire to be part of the compact and which want to adopt the common currency. Fourthly, recent changes in the draft of the document lead to marginalisation of the role of the EU institutions. The European Commission is deprived of the possibility of lodging complaints about Member States to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which was always its area of responsibility, and the European Parliament’s participation in Eurosummit meetings is being greatly marginalised.</literal>

               Mr President! I find myself in agreement with much of the text, especially the references to the need for the 27 different states of the EU to work together to resolve this aspect of the financial crisis. The Government of my own Member State, the UK, has been uniquely unconstructive: achieving nothing other than undermining the efforts of the others to resolve a difficult situation.

Sadly, the motion also included extraneous references to additional taxes, a redemption fund and eurobonds. While these may well be worth exploring, I do not believe we know enough about the implications of present proposals to back them actively as part of the solution. So I abstained, with some regret, on the final vote.</literal>

               I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the conclusions of the December European Council meeting today, because the resolution clearly states that the agreement that is now being negotiated between the Member States will be subordinate to current EU legislation. It also states that all Member States, irrespective of whether or not they have introduced the euro, will have the right to participate in the meetings with the Heads of State or Government that will be held by the parties to the agreement. However, I voted against the demands for a financial transaction tax and the introduction of Eurobonds.</literal>

               I voted for this joint resolution concerning the 8-9 December 2011 Summit as it: suggested that financial and economic consolidation could be achieved through EU law, not Intergovernmental Agreements (IA) or EU treaties; recognised the draft IA did not reflect European Parliament (EP) priorities; supported a stronger role for democratic input from the EP and welcomed inclusion of a parliamentary working group and gave all EU members (including the UK) participation rights in discussions.

The draft IA is still being developed, and already there are moves from Member States to dilute the fiscal requirements identified at the December summit (including the so-called ‘golden rule’). For the Single Currency to work there needs to be strong economic and fiscal union between Eurozone (EZ) members. I am not yet convinced that the EZ states will finally agree to necessary strict controls, and I am glad the UK is not part of it. I believe it is in the UK’s best interests to have a strong and stable euro, given that 40% of our trade is with EZ countries. For that reason, and the fact it was the only option achievable at this stage, I supported the resolution.</literal>

The new agreement must include an amendment to the effect that countries which will only join the euro area in the future also have the right to participate in Eurosummit meetings. Discussion should take place between all of the European Union’s Member States. I share the opinion of the European Commission, and think that the unity of the Union should be the overriding objective here.

Secondly, we should try to ensure that the new draft includes a clear provision about the primacy of EU law over the agreement which is being drafted. I am convinced that only the Community method is able to turn the Monetary Union into a truly strong economic and fiscal union. We are willing to hold further negotiations, and we are going to strive for the drafting of a constructive and solid agreement which includes our most important proposals.</literal>

We regret that, so far, the draft international agreement of January 2012 does not reflect Parliament’s proposals expressed by the Members appointed by the Conference of Presidents to represent Parliament as part of an ad hoc working group. The agreement should also include a commitment from the contracting parties to measures aimed at increasing the employment rate, convergence and EU competitiveness. The EU is a political project, based on strong common values and institutions and on respect for common rules. This is why monetary union can evolve into a real economic and fiscal union only through the Community method. All the contracting parties to the agreement, Member States which are or will be part of the euro area, must enjoy the same right to attend euro area summit meetings. I call for the draft international agreement on a Fiscal Stability Union to be debated publicly in every Member State and for democratic accountability to be guaranteed by strengthening parliamentary involvement both at EU and national level in every aspect of European economic coordination and governance.</literal>

However, this does not mean this is to take place at the cost of the unity of the Union and its institutions.

               . −2012 is a very important year for Europe, during which a credible and sustainable solution to the sovereign debt crisis needs to be proposed. I believe that the proposed fiscal treaty is a step in the right direction, but we should not lower our guard. It is true that no treaty can stop the crisis. If EU legislation currently in force had been properly implemented and had been properly upheld, we would not need additional legislation or more stringent agreements. Our prospects nevertheless remain bleak. According to data from Business Monitor International, this year Lithuania’s public debt is expected to reach 43% of GDP (as compared to 15.6% in 2008). I really hope that non-euro area Member States will be able to participate in negotiations on equal terms. The majority of Lithuanians are sceptical about the introduction of the euro against the backdrop of the debt crisis, which threatens the survival of the euro area. A survey carried out last month showed that 49% of Lithuanians are against the introduction of the euro and just 43% are in favour of it. This long-term Treaty is not enough for Lithuanians. They also need specific and urgent measures for combating the crisis in the immediate future.</literal>

               I believe that we need an effective and long-lasting solution to Europe’s financial crisis. However, I voted against this resolution because of the federalist nature of its proposals and its resolute yet ultimately futile attempts to push for an EU-wide financial transaction tax (FTT). This resolution calls for the use of the ‘Community method’ to create a fiscal and economic union. I am glad that the UK remains outside the eurozone. Giving up your national currency is bad enough, but I cannot imagine giving Brussels the power to scrutinise every penny the British Government spends. The financial crisis in Europe is serious; I cannot understand why Parliament is wasting its time in recommending an EU FTT. Taxation requires the unanimous approval of all 27 Member States and the UK has made it unambiguously clear that it will block such a tax as it would disproportionately affect my home constituency of London. The Commission’s own statistics reveal that the FTT would cost long-term growth in the EU EUR 220 billion with a 90 % decline in derivatives trading. Members of the European Parliament must dismount both their high horse and their hobbyhorse and realise that the FTT is a complete non-starter.</literal>

               I could not vote in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the conclusion of the last meeting of the European Council. I do not agree that Parliament should deny Member States the right to agree among themselves, as equal partners, on resolving pressing economic problems. If Europe is to overcome the crisis successfully, the Member States must regain the trust of the financial markets. The only proper way to regain trust is to take responsibility. Seeking other means, such as borrowing money for ineffective national and European projects, is precisely the type of thinking that led us into the crisis. It is a road to new public debts, a road to hell. I cannot therefore support a resolution that promotes the establishment of project bonds, the introduction of a financial transaction tax and stabilisation bonds. It is true that, if we are to overcome the crisis, it is not enough to reassess the level of well-being guaranteed by the State. It is necessary to create conditions that motivate the initiative of citizens, simplify their business and increase labour productivity. However, Europe is diverse and centralisation creates more problems than it solves. Even if we call it the ‘community method’.</literal>

               I believe that Parliament’s resolution on the conclusions of the European Council meeting (8-9 December 2011) on a draft international agreement on a Fiscal Stability Union cannot be endorsed, since many of the objectives laid down in it cannot be achieved in the foreseeable future for political reasons. Firstly, the call in paragraph 5 of the resolution to introduce such measures as a Europe-wide financial transaction tax and so-called stability bonds conflicts with the political positions of the majority of EU Member States. Agreement at intergovernmental level on these items has not yet been reached. Secondly, the scepticism expressed in paragraph 1 of the resolution regarding an intergovernmental agreement as a form for achieving the EU’s fiscal goals is not justified. The Council decided upon an intergovernmental agreement (a fiscal compact) precisely in order to avoid the long and complicated procedure of amending the EU Treaties, which would run counter to the current main task of convincing the financial markets that the euro area and the EU as a whole is determined to resolve this enormous crisis with speed and certainty. Thirdly, I cannot support the call to use the Community method to transform monetary union into ‘true economic and fiscal union’, which the majority of Member States wishing to retain their sovereignty may find unacceptable. At the same time, I welcome the fact that the majority of Members supported the proposal by Mr Brok to include in the resolution a call to give all the EU Member States, not just those that have joined the euro area, the right to participate in all euro summits.</literal>

Votes cast: 684

I will now read out the results.

Ms Geringer de Oedenberg: 237 votes

Mr HIGGINS: 284 votes

Mr Liberadzki: 222 votes

Ms LULLING: 297 votes

Mr Maštálka: 232 votes

Mr Newton Dunn: 177 votes

Mr SPERONI: 106 votes

None of the candidates has received the absolute majority of the votes cast. Therefore, all five seats remain unfilled and a second ballot is needed. I assume that all the candidates for the office of Quaestor wish to continue their candidacy. Is there anyone who wishes to withdraw his or her candidacy? No one wishes to do this, so we will move on to a second ballot with all these candidates.

I propose that we use the electronic voting system in this second ballot.

I will now announce the result of the vote:

Votes cast: 593. The absolute majority is 297. No one has achieved the absolute majority.

Ms LULLING: 280 votes

Mr HIGGINS: 263 votes

Ms Geringer de Oedenberg: 234 votes

Mr Maštálka: 226 votes

Mr Liberadzki: 209 votes

Mr Newton Dunn: 170 votes

Mr SPERONI: 114 votes

Therefore, we now need a third ballot where a simple majority applies. I have just been informed that the third ballot will take place this evening at 20:00.

I propose that we hold the vote now.

The third ballot will now take place. The vote can begin once all the candidates have stated that they wish to continue their candidacy. Would anyone like to withdraw? Everyone is continuing their candidacy.

I will now announce the result of the vote:

Votes cast: 600. The majority is therefore 301, but it is no longer required.

Ms LULLING: 273 votes

Mr HIGGINS: 254 votes

Ms Geringer de Oedenberg: 235 votes

Mr Liberadzki: 216 votes

Mr Maštálka: 207 votes

Mr Newton Dunn: 182 votes

Mr SPERONI: 104 votes

The following Members have been elected: Ms Lulling, Mr Higgins, Ms Geringer de Oedenberg, Mr Liberadzki and Mr Maštálka.

Does anyone who has been elected not accept the election? Everyone accepts it. I would like to congratulate all those who have been elected. I would also like to say that the Bureau of the European Parliament has now been fully elected and that we will constitute it as quickly as possible.</literal>

               –Mr President, Prime Minister Orbán, in 2010 Hungary’s citizens entrusted you by a very large majority with the task of carrying out reforms. You then took the reins of a country that was in a poor state both economically and in terms of corruption. This was one of the reasons for your unprecedented success in the general election.

The Hungarian people elected you with a clear mandate: to make a break from the political direction of the past, and to reform the country, as you have just said. This is what you undertook to do. Hungary was the last central and eastern European country to have kept its 1949 Stalinist constitution. The reform of the constitution was debated and adopted by the Hungarian Parliament, which also voted in the 30 ‘Cardinal Laws’. Criticisms were made over several of these laws, and doubts were raised as to their compatibility with European Union law. The only way to find out whether these criticisms and doubts are justified is to defer to the judgment of the European Commission, as guardian of the EU treaties. My group defers wholly to the Commission’s judgment, as it always does in situations of this nature.

Yesterday, as President Barroso just mentioned, the Commission issued Hungary with formal notice to amend three areas of its constitutional reforms within one month. Yesterday also, the Hungarian authorities said they were prepared to address the Commission’s requests, and today, at his own initiative, the Prime Minister has proposed to answer questions from Members of this Parliament directly.

Ladies and gentlemen, these are serious, weighty matters we are dealing with. We are talking about democracy, the rule of law, and Europe’s values. The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), at least in their capacity as the largest majority in this House, uphold the principles of freedom and democracy. Mr Orbán, I am sure, will prove to us that he also adheres to these principles and values.</literal>

               . –Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the Council for its clear statement and also the Commission. Some of us will certainly be of the opinion that the Commission could play a more active role in evaluating the situation. However, I do not want to call that into question here. I am grateful to you for what you have said, Mr Barroso.

Mr Orbán, this is not the first debate that we have held. You should not be surprised that we are discussing Hungary or, rather not Hungary, but what your government is doing. There have been complaints about some new laws, but these are important laws. They concern the independence of the data protection authority, the judiciary and the national central bank. This may even relate to the independence of the legal system as a whole. I am not intending simply to criticise the individual measures, but rather the spirit that lies behind them. You say that this is a reorganisation on the basis of European values. However, European values include democracy and changes of government. You want to prevent that from happening. You even want to continue exercising power in Hungary after a change of government. We are criticising the spirit that you represent.

Mr Daul, I am deeply disappointed by your statement. You said nothing about the spirit behind these moves. After all, Mr Orbán is the Vice-President of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). You should finally take the initiative. You are in a better position even than the Commission to tell Mr Orbán what is right and what is wrong with his policy. It is time that you did this.

What makes me particularly sad, Mr Orbán, is that, like me, you know many people who fought against National Socialism. They were imprisoned. Then they fought against communism. Now they are affected by your measures and they are saying: Why did we fight for freedom only to find that it is being taken away from us bit by bit? Mr Orbán, you must talk to these people. Listen to the people in Hungary if you do not want to listen to the Members of this Parliament.

Secondly, in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, President Buzek spoke about the great achievements of Václav Havel. Take Václav Havel as your example. He always fought against communism and in support of freedom.

Mr Orbán and the representatives of the Hungarian Government, I would like to thank you once again, also in my role as rapporteur for Croatia, for helping Croatia to join the European Union. However, you know as well as I do that Croatia with an Orbán government would not have been able to join the EU because it would not have met the criteria. You should at least make sure now, Mr Orbán, that Hungary fulfils the criteria.</literal>

               Mr President, first of all I have to tell you that I regret personally that this debate is a debate between the two sides of the House. If we have to discuss the basic values of the European Union, I do not think it is a good thing to have the type of reaction we have seen today.

I have here a little document listing in total 30 breaches of the Treaty, fundamental questions and serious concerns in relation to Articles 2 and 4 of the Treaty. These breaches, questions and concerns relate to the new Hungarian Constitution, the independence of the Hungarian judiciary, the new media law, the independence of the data protection supervisor, the position of the Hungarian central bank, the new church law and a lot of other issues, as well as the ‘cardinal laws’ that have recently been published.

Let there be no misunderstanding: I did not make this list myself. It is simply the summary of all the facts and all the complaints that you can find in official letters from official international authorities and official international organisations – the President of the Commission, the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Venice Commission, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the US Secretary of State. I did not add to this list all the complaints from other organisations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, or from the civil society representatives who are protesting in the streets. It is only the summary of official letters from official organisations that have complained. So saying that there is no major problem today in Hungary astonishes me.

Yesterday the Commission launched infringement procedures in relation to three questions. Let us be clear, Mr Barroso: there is more at stake. The issues that have been tackled today are mainly technical ones, and I know there is also an important letter, which you mentioned, that raises other questions. What is necessary here is not a debate on technical issues, as we had at the beginning of the year. This is about checking the conformity of the constitution and cardinal laws with the European values that are enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty: democracy, the rule of law, freedom of religion, freedom of expression and so on.

For all these reasons, besides the role that the Commission is playing with these infringement procedures, this House also has a responsibility under the Treaty to take action. That is why I am calling on all Members – not the right against the left or vice versa – in the Committee on Civil Rights, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to draw up a report, based on Article 7(1) of the Treaty, stating ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – and it can be ‘no’ – on whether there exists a clear risk of a serious breach of our values. That is what we have to do.

May I end with a personal message to you, Mr Orbán. Let us recognise, first of all, that you did a fantastic job in the past, together with so many other dissidents, in beating Communism and dictatorship, but I am afraid you are on the wrong path at the moment. Listen to what your comrades of the past are saying to you today. I shall repeat now an open letter sent to you a few days ago by your former colleagues, dissidents György Dalos, János Kenedi and György Konrád. They wrote to you that Hungary is an ‘example of what may happen wherever there is a concentration of crisis tendencies’ along with ‘authoritarian means and a policy of nationalistic isolation’. They end the letter by saying that it could be a good idea, Mr Orbán, to react sharply when someone wipes his shoes on liberal democracy, even if that someone is an old dissident…</literal>

Are you also aware that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is enshrined in the constitution and is legally enforceable, despite the fact that there are countries like the United Kingdom which negotiated an opt-out from Charter of Fundamental Rights under the leadership of Mr Blair?

               Mr President, I do not think that the problem is, in fact, about this or that article. The problem is the whole philosophy behind what is happening at the moment.

This is clearly expressed in a beautiful sentence from, in my opinion, the greatest Hungarian writer, Sándor Márai, who wrote in 1942 in a pamphlet... May I give it to you? You are not interested in it? Well, that is your problem.

The problem is that the European Union is based on values and principles and they are applicable everywhere – in the north, in the south, in the east and in the west – and that is what is at stake. It is not only about the euro: it is about our values.</literal>

               –Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I must be dreaming, because apparently public opinion in the whole of Europe has a headache. According to all the European newspapers, both right- and left-wing, there is a problem in Hungary. Yet here, the Hungarian Prime Minister and this Parliament’s right wing are telling us that there is no problem in Hungary. We must be completely schizophrenic.

Let me put this simply: the European Union is not a doormat for people to wipe their feet on. It is a shared home that we are building together, Mr Orbán. Yesterday, in Hungary you issued a press release in which you said, ‘I am going to go to Strasbourg to defend Hungary’s honour against attacks from the international and European left’. Let me tell you this: Hilary Clinton belongs to the European left; Angela Merkel belongs to the European left; Alain Juppé belongs to the European left; so welcome to the club! What is going on in this debate is purely for show, in my opinion.

Mr Orbán, you come here and you tell us that you have done all you can to change the constitution, which was a Stalinist constitution; and Mr Daul, your party’s spokesperson in this House, tells us that it was a Stalinist constitution. This means that this whole Parliament, including you and the whole lot of us, are utterly crazy, because we admitted a country with a Stalinist constitution into the European Union. You are completely crazy! It is not possible. How can you have done this? Shame on us!

However, Mr Orbán, at the time when you, together with your country and your party were about to become part of the European Union, I did not once hear the conservatives say, ‘wait until we change the Stalinist constitution before we go into the EU’. I never heard that. So why not stop this nonsense.

It is true that the country is taking a new direction. However, when you say new direction, this could mean the right direction or the wrong direction. We are here to tell you that you are going in the direction of Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro, and all the other totalitarian and authoritarian governments of this world that we all fight against, together with you; only you are not strong enough to fight when it comes to Mr Orbán.

I will give you three examples that affect me personally. The Mayor of Budapest, who belongs to the same party as Mr Orbán, has just appointed as a theatre director in Budapest a person who not only has contacts with the extreme right, but also a long history of antisemitism, and claims to be part of a group of Hungarian intellectuals of whom Viktor Orbán, when he was plain ‘Viktor’, said on leaving a theatre: ‘we will never support this intellectual’s nationalistic, antisemitic attitude in Hungary’. And now, these people are being brought back into the mainstream, with theparty’s approval.

If you disagree with me, let me suggest a very simple solution: let us follow Guy Verhofstadt’s suggestion and send a delegation via the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, under Article 7 of the Treaty, to find out why homeless people in Hungary are afraid; why intellectuals are afraid; why people from my family and other Jewish people I know in Hungary are afraid today; and why the spirit of your new constitution is that of a Hungary of the past, which frightens many Hungarian citizens. You may have a majority, but the minorities have the right to live in your country without fear, Mr Orbán. Therefore, if you are so sure of yourselves, and sure there are no problems with Hungary’s democracy, we should make use of Article 7, and see what kind of report comes back. If you are right, I will apologise; and if you are wrong, I will ask you to apologise to me, my conservative fellow Members, because if we are strong, we will even fight our own families if we have to, for the sake of freedom and democracy. It is easy to say that it is always other people, but when it is one’s own family that goes off the rails, it is the courage of those who fight for freedom that stands out, not that of collaborators.</literal>

               Mr President, during the holiday period the attention of the international media turned towards Hungary with unprecedented vigour. Not only left-leaning but also respectable conservative papers were full of stories about Hungary. Sadly, all serious reports were negative. Hungary is suffering from a double crisis: an economic and fiscal crisis as a result of the government’s irrational and at times openly dishonest and destructive policies.

We also have a legal and political crisis as a result of the new basic law and a series of cardinal laws approved in a hurry. The Commission has realised that something has gone seriously wrong in Hungary, but I call the attention of the European institutions to the fact that it is not only the law on the Central Bank data protection and the judiciary which violates the common values and legal rules of the EU: the legislative frenzy last December resulted in a carpet-bombing of the rule of law and the system of checks and balances.

All non-governmental state institutions have had their autonomy stripped away on a systematic basis. The new legal set-up has restricted the jurisdiction of the constitutional court, the ombudsmen and the competition office. It has emptied out the budget office and made a mockery of the court of auditors and media supervision.

Leaders of all state institutions have been appointed by the ruling party and will stay in office well beyond the mandate of the present government. Their term in office is secured by cardinal laws. To add insult to injury, many laws were approved without the slightest chance for the parliamentary opposition to influence their content.

Legislative drafts arrived at the last minute as individual initiatives inhibiting public debate and professional control. The old constitution, which was not a Stalinist one, was modified ten times in a period of one and a half years to avoid scrutiny. The first president of the constitutional court called this practice a destruction of the constitutional culture. The aim of this rampage was stated by the Prime Minister, who said in an interview last summer that he intends to tie the hands of the next ten governments.

As a result of this legal carpet-bombing, Hungary may become ungovernable for a long time. German papers labelled the government as ‘Rechtskonservativ’. It is a mistake. This regime nationalised the mandatory private pension system, trampling the sanctity of private property underfoot. Having destroyed the trust of investors it was not able to reduce public debt; it wasted 10% of GDP and had nothing to show for it. Pain and suffering was inflicted upon the people without any reason and result. Depositors now take their savings to Austria in droves. Populist and nationalist policies damage the interests of Hungary.

We true conservatives expect Europe to help us defend the rule of law and fight for the restoration of democratic institutions in Hungary. We know that it is our struggle and only the Hungarian people can bring about democratic change. Rest assured we will continue the fight.</literal>

               –Mr President, I cannot quite believe the sitting we are having this afternoon. Is it really democracy, the rule of law and human rights that we are talking about?

A Prime Minister of a Member State has travelled here to provide some explanations. This is unusual enough to be a noteworthy event, and we would be delighted by it if we did not think that it would be exploited for purely domestic political ends.

What exactly are we talking about today? We are talking about a constitution that was rushed through in a few weeks by a government taking advantage of the huge majority it gained in the national parliament: a majority which everyone knows is artificial.

This constitution was passed in April last year and came into force on 1 January this year. In the meantime, over 300 laws have been passed, 30 of which are ‘Cardinal Laws’ dealing with matters of some importance, to say the least, from the point of view of so-called ‘EU values’. These are matters such as the independence of the judiciary, certainly Mr Barroso, but also the threat to freedom of expression and media pluralism; the definition of nationality; abandoning the republican structure of the State; compromising the separation of Church and State by parading so-called ‘Christian values’; promoting a very narrow view of the family; challenging the status of minority groups, especially homosexuals and Roma people, and freedom of the unions. It is a long list, and no doubt I have forgotten something. The European Parliament alerted the Commission in July last year, Mr Barroso, but we had to wait until December before you became concerned about what was happening in Hungary, only to announce that we should keep an eye on the independence of Hungary’s central bank. A fine demonstration of what EU values really are!

The proceedings that were initiated yesterday are therefore not sufficient to deal with the problem, any more than the answers coming out of Hungary are. Fascism is knocking at Europe’s doors once again, in the shape of nationalism and fear mongering, taking advantage of the social consequences of the economic and financial crisis, which the European institutions are daily proving incapable of handling. We should indeed remember the past: but the whole of the past. At least within this Chamber, let us not allow history to stare in disbelief. Let us really help supporters of democracy in Hungary. No-one is manipulating them, Prime Minister; they are simply daring to believe in values that, as Aung Sang Suu Kyi reminded us this week, are universal: the values of democracy and human rights.</literal>

               –Mr President, in 1956, the movement for freedom and the national aspirations of Hungarians were brutally crushed by tanks from the Soviet Union. This happened only because the brave Hungarian people had the courage to claim their independent right to make decisions regarding their own internal affairs, to exercise their sovereignty and to run their own affairs.

Fortunately, those days are gone forever, but the fact that today the European Union is trying to use the institutions of the Union and financial pressure to restrict, once again, the free democratic choice of the Hungarian nation borders on a historical paradox. This time the Hungarian nation must defend its freedoms, its democratic elections and sovereignty in internal affairs against the attempts of transnational corporations that the European Commission represents in relation to Hungary. The issues of the constitution and free media legislation were only a pretext for attacking the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Orbán and his right-wing government, because they are rebuilding their country with courage after the terrible era of Communist governments and their post-Communist government heirs, because they have had the courage to impose taxes on banks and international corporations, because they had the courage to mention Christianity in their constitution, a beautiful national tradition, and the traditional concept of family, as opposed to left-wing political correctness, which shines in the salons of Europe. Please stand strong, Prime Minister, we are with you.</literal>

No, it is not Hungary; it is you, dear ladies and gentlemen, the European Union itself. It is you who made all those decisions which resulted in mass unemployment, mass poverty and mass suffering across Europe.

So it is very interesting and very bizarre that you teach us democracy. What is democracy about? Democracy is about representing your people. Who are you representing, ladies and gentlemen? Do your people in Greece, in Portugal and so on, the poor, the unemployed, want you to sit here for hours and hours and spend all the resources of the European Union on discussing the retirement age of Hungarian judges and the Hungarian data protection ombudsman, or would they want you to confess your sins?

Instead of investigating Hungary’s issues of sovereignty and self-determination, why do you not investigate yourselves, your decisions? Why do you not find out what should happen to Europe, what should happen to the poor and how you can end all the suffering that you, dear ladies and gentlemen, have caused?</literal>

  –Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit, I am addressing your chair, because for you democracy lasts only for as long as you proclaim your opinion in shrill tones, and when you should respond or listen to others, you leave the room. In that case I am happy to see that you are present, and I am happy that you can hear what I am saying, namely that on my own behalf, and on behalf of theParty and Hungary, I protest against the allegation of anti-Semitism. Jews in Hungary do not live in fear. It was Viktor Orbán’s first government that introduced the Hungarian Holocaust Memorial Day, and yesterday we – he himself – launched the Wallenberg Year in Hungary. If the Jews have something to fear it is not Viktor Orbán, nor his Government. Hungary is a democracy and protects minorities. We strongly object to such insinuations.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am a European, a member ofand a Hungarian democrat. I was a young lawyer when I began my fight for freedom against a dictatorial Communist regime. This freedom we did achieve. It is thanks to this that today Hungary is a European democracy. To this dayhas always stood up for this freedom, no matter what you might say. Today Hungary is a democratic Member State of the European Union and abides by the EU’s rules. If the Commission says that Hungarian law is in conflict with EU law, we listen to its opinion and change the law. We demonstrated this over the recent period. In the case of the Hungarian media law we did so within a few weeks. We are disciplined, dedicated members of this Community and wish to remain so.

Ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian people are astounded to read and hear what the foreign media have to say. They do not recognise their own country. We know that you, too, have read such reports. Recently a renowned French journalist who had written an article about Hungary was asked by a Hungarian television channel to describe how the article came to be. The journalist replied that he was not familiar with Hungary or the present situation, but had simply been given background material and had been asked to write an article. The article was naturally full of falsehoods and second-hand information.

Ladies and gentlemen, the attacks against Hungary are an indication that there is a task we here in the European Parliament and in the European Union have failed to fulfil, namely to acquaint ourselves with each other. You do not know Hungary. The accusations that are largely published in newspapers and other media are untrue. We can provide evidence regarding every single point. We are at your disposal should you so need. You do not know us. You do not know that in 2006 the Socialist Government brutally assaulted peaceful commemorators with mounted police charges and rubber bullets aimed at their eyes, that in 2006 tens of thousands of people demanded before the Hungarian Parliament every day for weeks that the Socialist Government which had lied to their faces resign. You should, however, learn about the immense efforts Hungary is making. Viktor Orbán has already told you what these were. There has been a compete transformation of Hungarian public administration and the Hungarian state.

You claim to be Europeans and democrats. Europeans and democrats listen to others. They do not make a judgement before even conducting the investigation. This is what we are asking of you. Conduct the investigation. Become acquainted with us, and it will become clear to everyone that Hungary is a democracy where the rule of law is respected, and that Viktor Orbán’s Government has not weakened, but in fact reinforced it.</literal>

  –Mr President, as a Hungarian patriot and as a European I have felt ill at ease during today’s debate. The Orbán Government fully deserves the sharp criticism, but such criticism also casts a shadow over my country. I am aware that when the European Commission is trying to make the Hungarian Government see reason it by no means intends to offend or even less punish the Hungarian people, and this is the way it should be. Still, even though the Hungarian Government has taken some measures that go against European values I find it excessive for anyone to call Viktor Orbán a Hugo Chavez, a Putin of the Puszta or a dictator. It is true, unfortunately, that we can no longer call him a true democrat either, but even the Hungarian Prime Minister is entitled to personal dignity.

I ask President Schulz, President Barroso and the Danish Presidency to make it clear to Hungarian citizens that the EU is not dictating or issuing commands, that this is not Europe’s style. The European Union is not an external power; after all, we Hungarians are part of this Community as well. We, too, make up the Union. As with every family, in the European Union it is customary, or even a moral obligation, to warn a family member who has strayed from the right path. Such straying hurts the member concerned the most, but it also harms the Community as a whole.

If in Hungary people are worse off, can be stripped arbitrarily of their acquired rights and their pension entitlements, and if millions of workers are punished while the rich are rewarded by a tax system cemented by a two-thirds majority, then it is mainly Hungarian society that suffers. Indeed, it is the Orbán Government that is punishing the Hungarian people and not the European Union it condemns. It is first of all in the interest of Hungary and only secondly in the interest of the European Union for Hungary to be once again characterised by a genuine rule of law, true freedom of the press, a responsible economic policy that avoids state bankruptcy and a government that can be removed from office if it has lost the trust of the majority. As a responsible patriot I wish for Hungary to once again be democratic and economically prosperous, and to follow a system of values that is both national and European. This is in the common interest of both Hungarian and European citizens.</literal>

  Mr President, Article 7(1) must be seen as a normal procedure provided for by our own Treaty to defend EU fundamental principles, values and rights. The infringement procedure started by the Commission is based on certain EU directives and does not touch on Article 2 of the Treaty.

The time has come for this Parliament, directly elected and representing the EU’s citizens, to prove it is capable of sending the right political message. We have received hundreds of messages from across Europe asking for just that. Let us be honest, no accession country would be allowed to join the European Union if the situation were similar to the one in Hungary today.

To give just a few examples: the parliament has become an annex of the ruling party, which imposes the legislation it wants, not only for now but for the decades to come. A highly respected constitutional court has been transformed into a weightless body. The independence of the judiciary is under severe threat, as the right to appoint judges and to promote them belongs to only one person: the chief of the national judiciary office elected for nine years by a two-thirds majority of Parliament, which in fact means Fidesz. The written press is dominated by self-censorship through the huge fine systems, the audiovisual media is politically controlled and frequencies are conferred in an arbitrary fashion.

If we add the decisions affecting the economic and financial system, we get a picture of a government which is doing its best to take absolute control of society as a whole. Fighting to secure full respect for fundamental rights and democracy in Hungary in fact means fighting to secure full respect for fundamental rights and democracy in the European Union.</literal>

               Mr President, a prime minister with a two thirds majority in his or her own parliament does not need to tinker with the constitution in order to achieve the results he or she wants. When one has such a large majority, there is no need to take the minority parties hostage, so that one can continue to rule from beyond the grave. Thus, a major question still remains about your motives. Why do you not just go down the normal route?

You will not be stopped from pursuing those motives by other countries. Nor will you actually be stopped by the Commission. As you, yourself, said, the likely outcome of an infringement procedure in which three issues are highlighted and in which another thirty-something are left until later – I would like to mention freedom of religion here – is that two or three things will be changed and then the infringement procedure will be discontinued, as we have witnessed in the case of the Media Act. Three amendments and then the Commission’s comments were withdrawn. Meanwhile, journalists are being stripped of their jobs and radio stations are losing their frequencies.

My question to you, Mr Orbán, is why do you, as a respectable, democratic politician in possession of a majority, not take the decent route?</literal>

  Mr President, I would say to Prime Minister Orbán that, as with every human undertaking, his has its faults and deserves fair criticism, but a lot of what we have heard today was not criticism but a series of angry outbursts on the verge of hysteria. Some of the regulations my colleagues criticised Hungary for, concerning the central bank or the supreme court, exist also in my country, Poland, but to criticise them never crossed their minds. Why? Because they approve of the Polish Government, and they disapprove of the Hungarian Government purely for ideological reasons.

When Hungary was ravaged by the Socialist government this Chamber shamefully kept silent. Why? Because of the disease of double standards. But there is also another disease: not to trust people. The people of Hungary are still supporting Mr Orbán’s government. Why do we not trust those people? After all, it is they, and not the EU, who are the real guardians of democracy. Prime Minister Orbán, I wish you and the Hungarian people every success.</literal>

  –Mr President, yesterday the Legal Service of the European Commission found that the new Hungarian Constitution infringes the European Treaties. Our view is that this infringement must be stopped, preferably with new amendments in a positive direction by that country’s government which, as we have heard today, the Hungarian Government is willing to do, or with legal measures by the European Commission in line with the Treaties which make provision for compatibility between national laws and the European.

This position is not directed against the Hungarian people, whose integrity we fully respect, nor is it directed against Hungarian national sovereignty; it is directed against policies that infringe the rights of citizens in light of the directive on equal treatment at work or the existence of an independent central bank or independent data protection authority.

Even though the focus is on these three points, this should not be used as an excuse to overlook the other constitutional changes. Nor should interest and reaction be confined to the question of the media or the Charter of Fundamental Rights, leaving aside other constitutional …</literal>

  –Mr President, I think that I am not the only one who does not like this spectacle of calling the Prime Minister of Hungary to account. I think that the founding fathers of Europe - Schuman, de Gasperi, Adenauer – must be turning in their graves today, as they see how the Europe of free nations which they created is turning into a super-bureaucracy that tries to interfere with national sovereignty. Strasbourg is not Canossa, Mr Orbán is not Henry IV and no explanations are required in relation to anybody.

Whom did Mr Orbán offend? He mainly offended big capital, because he had to rebuild a bankrupt country following half a century of Communist governments and their Socialist descendants, to put the country back on its feet. To this end, he taxed big capital. I refer to banks, telecommunications and energy companies, hypermarkets. For this, today he is facing a furious frontal media attack.

He faces the fury of the European Left, because instead of renouncing Christian values, he proudly included them in the Hungarian Constitution. In Hungary, marriage is between men and women, life is protected from conception, and the world finally makes sense. Hungary also faces the fury of Socialists, because Hungary holds Communist crimes to account today, and its constitution clearly states that Communism was tyranny.

In addition, Hungary faces the fury of Russia, because Hungary effectively resisted Russian influence and regained control over MOL - the largest fuel company.

Prime Minister, may you continue to wear your suit and not be forced to don penitential sackcloth. We are with you. Truth will prevail. Long live a free Hungary!</literal>

               Mr President, Prime Minister, the Hungarian voters have given you a two-thirds majority in your parliament, and that has led to a gnashing of teeth amongst the leftist parties, who are now trying to use the European Parliament to get their own back. Your people courageously fought against communist oppression, only to now discover that the Brezhnev doctrine lives on, in the form of EU intervention against Member States which refuse to fall into line.

Many speeches in this debate have been, not only hysterical, but hypocritical, too. What should one think of the President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who is now lecturing you on democratic rights, while, under his premiership in Belgium, one of the largest Flemish parties, the Flemish Bloc, was outlawed because of the political positions which it took? Nowhere else in the European Union has anything like that ever happened and yet nobody in the European Parliament or the Commission seems to have had a problem with it. In other words, this is the old story of one set of rules for some, another for others, which is exactly what makes this European Parliament so unreliable.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have principles in the European Union, including the independence of the judiciary and the central bank and fundamental democratic rights. If there are any doubts about these fundamental rights or principles, we need to discuss them. The right place for these discussions is here in the European Parliament. For this reason, I would like to emphasise specifically how grateful I am to Mr Orbán, the Prime Minister of Hungary, for coming here. He was not invited. He said: I will take part in the discussion, because we have nothing to hide. I would like to emphasise too that Mr Orbán is here and is listening while many of those Members who were so hysterical and dramatic that they could hardly contain themselves have obviously already left the Chamber. He is still here and we should acknowledge that.

If we leave the party politics to one side, the facts are quite simple: Europe has ground rules which apply to all of us. The job of the Commission is to ensure that everyone follows these rules and that is what it has done. The Hungarian Government has already promised on several occasions to deal with these problems and to make the necessary changes. These are the facts. If we could simply put aside the political hysteria, then we would be able to talk objectively about the situation. I have heard nothing new today from those on the left concerning the facts. Mr Swoboda stands up and says that the judiciary may be independent. Then I hear from Mr Orbán that there was absolutely no criticism of the constitution. Next Mr Verhofstadt says that this is not about individual legal details. It is about the fundamental question of whether Hungary is still democratic.

We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stand for law and justice. If anyone has a criticism, they must substantiate it objectively and in terms of its content with regard to the judicial issues and not simply claim that someone has acted undemocratically.

What we are experiencing in many areas is quite simply an arbitrary approach. If I do not like a specific aspect of the legislation in Hungary, I describe it as undemocratic, radical and right-wing or totalitarian. We in the PPE Group will not tolerate this.

Finally, I would like to say that I have been working in this Parliament since 2004. I was involved with the case of Slovakia, which introduced a law banning the use of the Hungarian language there. All of the people on the left who are now getting so angry …

  –Mr President, although some people may have lost sight of this fact, the European Union is about more than just markets and finances. More than anything, it represents values and principles. Similarly, the crisis that is reverberating throughout the European Union concerns not only the euro and its governance, but, also its values and principles, which are being threatened by the uncertainty and fear causing negative reactions against Europe and a resurgence of nationalism.

However, Europe was not built on nationalist confrontation but, rather, on a supranational effort to subject all of the Member States to legally-binding legislation from which no Member State is immune.

That is why, when the European institutions express their concern regarding the Hungarian reforms they are acting on behalf not only of the 500 million Europeans represented in this Parliament, but also of the 10 million Hungarians represented in this Parliament with regard to their rights as European citizens.

There is nothing against Hungary, certainly nothing against the Hungarian people, not even against the Hungarian Government, which was elected at the polls. There is, however, concern for the rights of Hungarians as European citizens, and a need for this Parliament to convey the message that democracy is not just majority rule, but it also concerns the protection of minorities. I refer not just to ethnic and religious minorities, but also to political minorities who have the right to rotation in government.

Furthermore, democracy also includes an independent judiciary and the power of the Constitutional Court to control the laws made by legislative power; and a judiciary where the way in which cases are assigned is is determined by a judge established by law. Under no circumstances should there be political interference. Citizens should be guaranteed the right to privacy, with authorities who are independent from the government, and the right of information should be expressed through pluralism of information so that there may be a contrast between opinions and democratic principles may be properly developed.

I believe that we in this House who are representing 500 million citizens have the right to hear the Hungarian Prime Minister make a commitment to reaffirm those values to which Hungary promised to adhere when it ratified the Treaties of the Union seven years ago.</literal>

  –Mr President, Mr Orbán, I would like to make one thing clear straight away: Hungary is not Belarus, you are not Mr Chávez and it is possible to live a good life in Hungary. Nevertheless, we do have serious concerns. I am intending to link my criticisms to specific points, as Mr Weber has called on us to do.

You said that no one had criticised the constitution. There are now 25 ‘cardinal laws’, which raise some issues to the level of the constitution because a two-thirds majority is required to change them again. One of these is the flat tax. I am a Liberal and I think a flat tax is an excellent idea. However, it is not acceptable to take a tax policy issue out of the political debate and include it in the constitution. This undermines and impairs the citizens’ democratic right to vote, to choose a different government at the next elections and to bring about comprehensive change. Tax law is a question which must stimulate central political debate and democratic disputes. This situation is unacceptable because it undermines democracy and that is why it is so serious.

Incidentally, you have said, and this was the point which concerned the judicial system, that this is all about the independence of the judiciary and about facts. The Prime Minister has said that he has done everything possible to consolidate the budget. How can he then reduce the retirement age for around 300 judges from 70 to 62? That will cost the state a lot of money. Of course, new judges will have to be appointed to fill the vacancies. That is all well and good. We have our own ideas about who they will be. I think we understand that very well.

A year ago we expressed our criticism of the media law. We were told that the pluralism of the media was not at risk. Now Klubrádió is being closed down. It has already been closed in Budapest and the frequencies are now being shut down in the countryside. Mr Orbán, you have said that you have written a letter to Mr Barroso in order to discuss the situation calmly and objectively. In the BILD newspaper today you explained that you are yielding to power.</literal>

I know quite a few colleagues from the European People’s Party who are very critical of the authoritarian spirit that Mr Orbán and his Fidesz party have been installing in Hungary.

Why does not anyone in the European People’s Party speak out about that, if they see it as critical and are afraid of this violation of the European spirit, as Mr Barroso has said, and the violation of the common values which many of us – including Mr Orbán – fought for twenty years ago, before the Iron Curtain fell? Why does not any one of you tell Mr Orbán: ‘We are here to debate with you what you have to change in the constitution and the various laws to do away with this authoritarian spirit that so many people in Hungary are afraid of’?

That is all to the good, but Prime Minister Orbán should be careful not to fall into the same trap as his Communist predecessors, namely trying to exercise maximum hold over numerous sections of society. That would crush freedom and individual responsibility.

Because I, too, am concerned about the growing political influence on the Bank of Hungary. I, too, am concerned that politicians might start appointing hundreds of new judges. However, many of you in this House have reacted too hastily. The idea that we ought now to suspend Hungary’s membership is left-liberal nonsense, in my view.

Mr Orbán, today all the patriots among us feel Hungarian, feel proud to be Hungarian, and we envy your people for experiencing a new-found freedom after conquering it in the way that it did. Come and visit us in Padania, where you will receive a hero’s welcome, because we welcome those who defend their sovereignty. You will be welcomed as a Prime Minister who, unlike others such as our own Prime Minister, is not a servant to powerful lobbies, and perhaps this is why you do not have the favour of international finance, given that it seems to want to tie the financial hands of a free Hungary, denying it the support that is provided without question to every other country in difficulty.

I believe it is time to say that perhaps our peoples should be the ones to open infringement proceedings against those who, without a popular vote, have devolved their sovereignty to others, have abandoned their sovereignty, starting with monetary sovereignty, and I invite you to defend your country's monetary sovereignty.

  Mr President, this debate is unprecedented. It is the first time we have debated infringement proceedings of this nature in this institution and in the presence of the highest European authorities, including no less than the Prime Minister of the country at the centre of the debate.

This unprecedented situation calls for us to assume our respective responsibilities, but also to respect each other’s institutional role. This means that we must respect the role of the Commission to start infringement proceedings and we must support it in its decisions. I would like to tell Mr Alvaro that we must also support the Commission if it decides not to start Article 7 proceedings. We must respect that too.

This means that we must allow time for the matter to be discussed, and hopefully resolved, between the Commission and the Hungarian authorities, and the declaration of Prime Minister Orbán in this sense is very much to be welcomed. But it also means that we must distinguish between the legal process – the due process – and the public political debate. This House can very well express its political views, but this is not a tribunal and it should not replace the legal and judicial process.

We should therefore give time for the legal process to take place and hold back from jumping to conclusions until this process, led by the Commission, is completed. Further action on our part at this stage is not just premature, but could also do more harm than good because it would damage the respect that our institution enjoys with the Hungarian people as much as it would damage the image of Hungary.

So let us support the Commission in its role as the guardian of the Treaties, let the Hungarian authorities rectify all laws that are found to be in breach of EU laws, but let us give the legal process time to run its course.</literal>

Communications at home are quite contradictory: on one hand, the Government asserts that only minor technical adjustments are necessary, and on the other hand, it claims that it is the lies of an international left-wing conspiracy against which it is up to the Prime Minister to defend Hungary. Hungary, however, does not need to be defended against this criticism, because it is not addressed at Hungary, but at you and your politics, which alienate our partners, isolate the country and worsen Hungary’s possibilities to assert its interests, thereby boosting the premium on our debt and weakening the forint.

Hungary acceded to the European Union voluntarily and not because it bowed before its power. It agreed with the EU’s values and with democracy. Democracy, social harmony, and a balanced framework for diversity, the peaceful resolution of naturally occurring conflicts and social unity – these are the things it wished for. This is exactly what is wrong with the basic law: it undermines the independence of the institutions that guarantee the peaceful resolution of social conflicts, and it is therefore not a minor mistake but an attempt on democracy to prematurely abolish the office of data protection ombudsman, to remove the impartial and critical President of the Supreme Court from office, and also to restrict the powers of the Constitutional Court, to stigmatise and criminalise the poor, and to exercise government control over the public media. Without democratic checks and balances we are at the risk of a social eruption.

Prime Minister, you may have a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian Parliament, but today 84% of people surveyed are of the opinion that things are awry in the country. Today’s debate is also a test of the independence of the public media in Hungary. Will they deliver a balanced report on this debate? I therefore ask Parliament’s media services to monitor the presentation of today’s debate in the Hungarian public media and to compare it with international media reactions.</literal>

  Mr President, this debate is actually not about Hungary and it is certainly not about Mr Orbán. This is actually a test for Europe. This is a question that we have to put to ourselves. Are we willing to defend our common values when it really comes down to it, when those values are under pressure? Can the rules that we have laid down in the treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in European legislation, actually be enforced? That is the question that we have to answer here today.

As Mr Verhofstadt, the leader of our Group, said, this is not about objections to single measures. It is about the accumulated impact of all those measures together, which justifies the activation of the Article 7 procedure.

I am actually quite surprised at the attitude of the EPP Group, because if it is true that all the allegations against the Hungarian Government are lies and invented by the media, then it should embrace the Article 7 procedure as an opportunity to prove them all wrong. I also hope – and here I am looking at the other side of the House – that we will get the support of the Socialist Group for the proposal of the Liberal Group and the Greens to use the Article 7 procedure.

Finally, I think that this debate should not distract from the fact that there are violations in nearly all Member States of the European Union. Just as the debate on Greece was more about exposing the weakness of the eurozone as a whole, the debate today is not about Hungary: it is about the values of Europe, and whether we are willing to defend them.</literal>

I know, Mr Orbán, that it is not nice for you to listen to criticism of your government, and I strongly believe that, if it were not for the fact that you very urgently need to borrow money from us to save your bankrupt economy, you would not demean yourself by listening to this discussion on your political errors. However, you are dependent on help from your European partners, whose correct criticisms you have only laughed at so far, and your neighbours, who, the speaker of Parliament, Lázsló Kövér, publicly says would best be dealt with by military force. Despite what you are doing to your country, Mr Orbán, we feel obliged to help the Hungarian people in their difficult economic situation. To help the Hungarian people, but not the regime ruling them.</literal>

  Mr President, I have not seen Mr Orbán’s government calling for an occupation of Wall Street in Budapest. What we are taking about is improving the governance of the central bank to achieve more transparency and accountability in cooperation with the government.

The independence of banks should not be misinterpreted as inaccountability, especially in view of their role in recent financial bunga-bungas. We should not serve the corporate interest of bankers. The solidarity of democracy should prevail over the solidarity of banks.

Therefore I call for cooperation, not an arbitrary confrontation. One special point: in my country, Lithuania, the Eurosceptics always try to compare the unfortunate Soviet Union – which was no union – with our true union of democracies. We European politicians in Lithuania have consistently refused to accept any such mistaken parallel.

Now it will not be easy to avoid comparisons with 22 years ago when Lithuania adapted her own independent constitution and was pressured by the Kremlin’s ultimatums to denounce it. There then followed political and economic sanctions, a blockade and finally bloodshed.

The Commission was ill advised in using the word ‘sanctions’ when addressing Hungary on its alleged serious infringements. Our suggestions to Hungary should not take the form of diktats from Commission experts, using Parliament as merely a tool to take action against disobedient Member States. This would create a very serious situation, more serious even than being forced to live under a Communist-era constitution for a considerable length of time.</literal>

               Mr President, Prime Minister, today I speak not as a politician of the left or right, but as a former journalist who is deeply concerned about freedom of the media.

I have read in detail a series of reports by prominent journalists' organisations and the facts are deeply troubling for the future of independent journalism in Hungary. Media legislation does not meet European standards on media freedom. Recent events should be the concern of every European citizen who believes in democracy, media freedom and fundamental rights.

How do you explain, Mr Orbán, that in the course of reallocating frequencies, the Media Council, which does not have a single member drawn from the opposition parties, revoked the licence of Klub Radio, one of the few remaining independent radio stations, and that this very council also sets extremely high financial penalties for the media?

How do you explain the Minister of the Interior’s recent threats to bring criminal charges against a journalist who published a concerning letter from President Barroso on a blog, claiming it is a breach of privacy, and that this journalist could even receive a lengthy prison sentence?

These facts may present an extremely serious threat to freedom of the media, creating fear and unease among journalists.

Since I have this information, it does not surprise me that today the Hungarian media have largely reported on yesterday's warnings from the Commission as if they were no big deal. Today's debate shows just the opposite. We expect you to respect democratic values, as we do throughout Europe, and as the Hungarian people deserve.</literal>

  –Mr President, President of the Commission, Prime Minister, let me reassure you straight away that I am not a leftist. I am a liberal and a European democrat. I am not part of any plot or attempt at subversion. Now you know!

However, I will say that the policy you are conducting in your country, Prime Minister, will be fatal for democracy. The laws you have passed contradict European values, and the Treaties. Your concept of democracy is nothing more than mathematics. This can only lead to something akin to what history calls the ‘tyranny of the majority’, which of course is a perverse approach to democracy.

You are threatening the independence of the media, the judiciary, the police and the central bank, and threatening the protection of privacy. You are establishing a policy of fear among citizens. In practice, you are using your mathematical majority to dissuade people from exercising their right to freedom of opinion. That is what you are doing in reality. All of this is incompatible with European values, and needless to say it is a serious deviation.

Lastly, I want to tell you what I find most troubling in this debate, and I say it with great sympathy and respect for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE): it is your deafening silence and complicity with respect to Mr Orbán, my PPE friends. You are in the best position to make him see reason.</literal>

  . –Mr President, I firmly believe that the Orbán government has acted in good faith in its administration of government, and in compliance with European values. It demonstrated this when it took into account the recommendations made by the European Commission regarding the mass media law. I strongly believe that it will demonstrate this again now with regard to the issues raised in the letter it received from the European Commission.

In Hungary, just as in other countries, there is discontent; in this case, discontent surrounding the Orbán government, which has had to take tough economic measures that the Hungarian people has had to bear, in order to rectify the major economic imbalances left by the previous administration. I believe that other countries too would have done well to adopt some of these economic measures. I would give the temporary additional tax on banks as an example, a measure which has faced a huge barrage of criticism in the sector press and in other publications and columns. However, it is a just measure in relation to the irresponsible behaviour shown by banks not only in Hungary, but also in other countries, with regard to lending to the general public. Many of the difficulties which these economies are currently faced with are due to this reckless behaviour. I would like to wish the Orbán government every success.</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like to express my satisfaction at witnessing this House, which was elected by direct universal suffrage, debating political matters that are vital for solidarity within the European Union. However, at the same time, it is not a very promising sign that we are examining Hungary’s democratic system for the third time in less than a year. This calls into question not only the developments in Hungary and the wave of populism it is experiencing, but also the general state of some of our European democracies, where democratic debate is in trouble, when it is not over-simplified or biased.

Nonetheless, it is crucial for us to ensure that all members taking part in the European project abide by our shared rules, especially considering that we do not fail to call to order a State that is not adhering to our sacrosanct budgetary rules, as is happening at present.

It is also unacceptable to dismiss the values that must be upheld before finding the golden key to unlock the door to the European Union, and to take it upon oneself to stop upholding them once admitted to the circle. The step taken by the Commission yesterday in initiating infringement proceedings, which in any event is part of its mandate as guardian of the Treaties, must be acknowledged. However, I think we must not content ourselves with simple adjustments to legal aspects, especially if we will soon have to revisit the Hungarian situation from the point of view of social matters.

We know where Parliament and the Commission stand, therefore, but what about the Council? With a very few exceptions, there is a deafening silence coming from the Council also.

Ultimately, my greatest hope, although I am not at all sure that this will happen, is that this debate will send a message to the Hungarian people that Europe, through the Members of the European Parliament today, at any rate, is aware of their difficulties and is not neglecting or forgetting them.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the debate that we are listening to oscillates between a series of comments on the merits, which should be commended for their clarity – the Commission’s for example – and at the same time the Hungarian Government’s desire to go into detail not only in order to specify its own position but also to seek solutions together, and at the other end of the scale an ideological position that we are, unfortunately, used to hearing here, which in actual fact risks producing the opposite effect to the one it intends.

In the last few days, following an ideological turn to the debate, we have in fact seen the European flag being burned in Hungary. This is a mere taste of what can happen when there is no perception of criticism and a desire to go into detail, but it can spark off populist reactions because it tends to divide those who have fought with good reasons, perhaps different from others’, but in any case for freedom, justice and democracy, from those who do not have a democratic approach.

I now want to propose a very simple solution, which I will call the ‘Schulz solution', because I am referring to the words that you, Mr President, used in the meeting with our group. You said that attempting to cite Article 7 to criticise a government without looking at the issues in detail and simply accepting and listening to the responses of the government itself actually only produces the effect of making it stronger. You mentioned as an example what happened with the government that had Jörg Haider in the coalition in Austria a few years ago. I think your words were sensible. I recognise this, but I do not wish to manipulate what you said. Therefore I am merely restating them here (…) and asking everyone to think carefully about them.</literal>

  –Mr President, it is good that the Commission is now taking action, but a strictly legal analysis of individual laws is far from sufficient, because the problem is, essentially, not that EU legislation is being contravened; rather the problem is a political one. It boils down to the fact that the conservative Hungarian Government refuses to respect fundamental democratic ground rules.

The new laws threaten the independence of a whole series of democratic institutions, far more than those pointed out by the Commission. Social and human rights as well as the independence of the media are also under threat.

Today’s debate is not a left-leaning conspiracy against Hungary, which is what Mr Orbán is trying to turn it into. Instead, it is about fundamental democratic values that we should all apply right across Europe, including in Hungary. The Hungarian people deserve better than the autocratic behaviour that Mr Orbán’s government is demonstrating.

However, the strongest pressure for change should be exerted by the governments of the other Member States. Unfortunately, these are almost all now conservative governments of the same ilk. The fact that Europe’s right had not previously dared to criticise Mr Orbán has led to the situation that we are in now. If the right-wing Hungarian Government refuses to listen, I believe that we should introduce sanctions.</literal>

  –Mr President, I was not a Member of the European Parliament during the last session, so I should like to raise an issue that may sound a little naive, but I should like to raise this issue. The elections prior to Mr Orbán’s victory elected a socialist prime minister whose name history has now forgotten; I myself do not even wish to remind you of it. He announced to his parliamentary group, to his citizens, to his co-citizens and to all his European partners that he had told clear lies throughout his election campaign. At that time, I never saw – as far as I know, though I should like to be corrected, if possible – the whole of the left in this House calling for a debate on the situation in the country during that period.

One thing is certain: Mr Orbán was not new to politics in last year’s elections. He has been in politics for more than 20 years and has already been prime minister before. When the Hungarian people give him a clear two-thirds majority it is because, essentially, they want reforms and it is these reforms that the prime minister is making at the moment. What I should like is for this House, this Parliament, to not have one rule for one and another rule for another; for there to be no double standards in our actions.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the history of the Hungarian people, it is particularly tragic that their own government is now withholding important rights from the citizens of Hungary. I would like to say to some speakers that even if a party was really elected by two-thirds of the people entitled to vote, it still has a specific responsibility in a democratic system to ensure that the political minority can present its views in the media and that the political minority is personally represented in the media, in the judiciary and in other areas. This is a principle which lies at the heart of democratic systems and it is a tragedy that this is not happening.

The fact that we have to hold this debate today, and it is a good thing that we are doing so, is not just a result of the way in which the Hungarian Government is acting. It is also because the Council was not able in the past in the case of Hungary and in other situations to take up a clear position and to put the European values centre stage. It is also the fault of the European Commission, which has so far failed in its role as guardian of the Treaties. In the case of the independence of the judiciary, it is not about checking whether the change in the upper age limit for judges is in line with the anti-discrimination directive, instead we need to evaluate the entire package. Is the assumption justified that in future only members of a certain party will be represented in certain areas?

I believe that, in the current difficult situation and in order to overcome the major challenges which face us, we need all the Member States and all the citizens of the European Union. For this reason, we must focus on values and not on individual laws.</literal>

I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Mr Orbán in 1989, when he was the leader of a student organisation and I was one of the leaders of a similar organisation in Poland. We met in Warsaw and talked not only about how to overthrow Communism; we talked about Europe and about the future, about our future in Europe. We talked about Mr Orbán’s dream that Hungary would become a European state. Hungary is a European state, and, in my opinion, Mr Orbán is a democrat and a European. He fought for human rights, and he fought for democracy, as opposed to some of his critics in Hungary, who built a totalitarian system. This should not be forgotten.

One message for President Cohn-Bendit, who is unfortunately leaving: we recognise your support of democracy in Eastern Europe. I hope that you have not forgotten what totalitarianism is. If you have forgotten, I suggest – I am sure Prime Minister Orbán will invite you to Hungary – that you spend one month in Hungary and one month with Mr Chávez. You will surely discover the difference.</literal>

  –Mr President, as the Danish Prime Minister said in her Presidency speech earlier today, the Union is based on fundamental values such as transparency, legal certainty and democracy. With these values we have united Europe and established peace in Europe. We have a particular duty to safeguard these values, especially at a time of crisis when they are placed under particular pressure.

The developments in Hungary are very worrying at this time in particular. Nationalistic forces with Viktor Orbán at the forefront are threatening to undermine the foundation of the rule of law and break with the threefold division of power. I am therefore extremely pleased that the Commission is now taking Hungary to task over this. The Commission’s criticism is currently directed at the Hungarian Government’s supervision of the national bank, the judiciary and the data authorities. At a time when elsewhere in Europe we are raising the retirement age, Mr Orbán’s government intends to reduce the retirement age for judges – an initiative that critics regard as an attempt to tailor the composition of the Constitutional Court. We must not ignore the fact that there is also discrimination against minorities like the Roma and homosexuals either, nor must we forget the attempts by Mr Orbán’s government to control the press. What about women’s rights? I can assure Mr Orbán that I will keep an eye on the Hungarian abortion legislation in future after reading the new Constitution.

A true democracy includes respect for minorities and allows room for a critical press and an active opposition. Many Hungarians are currently demonstrating against the government’s conduct and by no means approve of its policies. The many citizens who are fighting for democracy and legal certainty in Hungary deserve our solidarity.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been a Member of this House since 2004 and since then there have been on several occasions proven, actual and significant violations of fundamental freedoms here in the European Union, and these were not just rumours. We need only remember what has already been mentioned here, namely the events of the autumn of 2006 in Budapest, which the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg also deemed a serious violation of freedoms, and yet back then you were not so sensitive about freedoms because it was a Socialist government you would have needed to condemn. This is what I, together with an increasing number of people in Europe, call double standards, and in response to those who bring up the issue of compliance with the accession criteria, well, a great many old Member States would today fail to comply with those criteria, if for nothing else then for the lack of protection afforded by them to minorities.

Twenty years after Hungary’s democratic transition we have finally reached a point where we can set our legal system right and make it European. This is demanded by the present economic situation, and to an even greater extent by the majority of Hungarians, because our fundamental laws were unable to undergo renewal even in a period of 20 years. For all that time judicial decisions took years to be delivered, hundreds of pseudo-churches unrightfully received state subsidies, minorities lacked parliamentary representation, and votes did not carry equal weight due to disproportionalities between electoral districts. You do not agree with some of these legislative provisions and the Commission is expecting amendments on certain points. This is understandable as this is their job, as long as the opinions are based on facts; however, what is not acceptable is that you make judgements on the basis of an unfounded press campaign and press rumours, mention words such as dictatorship and call into question the free democratic rights of Hungarian voters.

I have asked my fellow Members how many of them have actually read the constitution and the laws under discussion, and in every case they replied that they know them and have read about them only from press rumours.</literal>

  –Mr President, when we talk about defending European values, left-wing and right-wing do not come into these matters. This is why I am surprised at my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) who are defending their party position without putting forward too many arguments, rather than the objective European position. The events taking place in Hungary are obviously at odds with European values, but the problem is even bigger than this.

Other countries, such as Romania and Bulgaria, have similar processes which are perhaps not as extreme, but also do exist. As a result of this, the measures which will be adopted by both the European Commission and European Parliament will be of paramount importance in indicating to anyone wishing to follow this path that this option is not possible.

Many examples on this point can be given. The last presidential and local authority elections held in Bulgaria were an example of how democratic elections should not be run. This observation appears in the report from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is a fact that the media in Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are dependent on their governments. It is also a fact in Bulgaria that absolute party pressure is exerted on independent regulators, where staff at all the independent institutions were obliged to submit their resignation and be replaced by faithful party officials.

Pressure is exerted on the judicial system in these countries as an everyday occurrence. Investors are abandoning these countries not due to the economic risk, but rather to the political risk. These are issues which must be examined in the European Union. They have come about specifically because they conflict with European values. The fact something is legal does not mean that it is just.

Many governments have gone down the legal route and applied repressive measures, including in Bulgaria’s history. This is why measures must be adopted by both the Commission and Parliament.</literal>

I have been a member of this Parliament for several years, and I challenge anyone to find a precedent to a debate such as this, where two opposing factions are railing against a country. I think that this could constitute a dangerous precedent. I say this to you, Mr President, as yesterday you made a fine speech in which you guaranteed Parliament’s independence and purpose.

We are committing an outrage against a country’s sovereignty, because the process of European integration is a delicate, judicial and institutional issue in which sovereignty has to merge with a supranational element, and this sovereignty achieved for freedom – and we have all recognised the achievement of Mr Orbán and his country in winning this deserved place in Europe – has not, as Mr Szájer rightly said, allowed us to listen to each other.

There have been invectives against a country relating to generic and sketchy issues, and to information from the media, some of which, to tell the truth, I did not know about. Mr Orbán has said that there is a constitution, and transitional and provisional laws that will lead to a result which will be difficult but is the one naturally hoped for, because the past, the battles and lack of freedom the country has suffered have put a lot of pressure on civil society, the political forces, democracy, the government and the parliament.

Therefore I believe that we must do justice to this and take into account the fact that, as has been said, the Commission must guarantee the Treaties. The Commission therefore …</literal>

However, this economic crisis cannot be used as an excuse for stirring populism which is detrimental to European democracy because it is precisely this populism which provides the basis on which regimes are formed with obvious discretionary traits.

In the case of Hungary, we have expressed on more than one occasion in this House our concern about the restrictions imposed on press freedoms, state institutions, the political opposition and on citizens’ rights. I would like to tell you, Prime Minister, that your extremist rhetoric also poses a threat to stability in the region due to the implications for ethnic coexistence in the neighbouring countries. I would welcome it if Prime Minister Orbán would tell us here today to what extent he approves of and encourages the demands for autonomy which come enthusiastically from members of the political group he belongs to, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We have strived for the last 20 years to join the European Union and create stability in the region. I believe that you, Prime Minister, must continue this work and not reward and offer a platform to those who promote ethnic hatred, because our region, Prime Minister Orbán, cannot be allowed to become the powder keg of Europe again.

This is the sixth day that mass demonstrations are taking place in dozens of Romanian cities, with thousands of citizens demanding the resignation of the president and of an incompetent, provocative government which repeatedly displays signs of antidemocratic abuse, taking advantage of the European Union’s guilty passive stance.

This makes him to a certain extent a trendsetter and we should use this as an opportunity to invite the governments involved in future treaty infringement proceedings to take part in discussions. This does not have to be in plenary; it could also be in the relevant committee.

I am pleased that here we have a government which is open to criticism and which has promised to make changes to rectify the issues that have been identified as being incompatible with the. It has already done this in the case of the media law. I think it is also important for us to remember how this government’s predecessors behaved. I recall, as other Members may do, the famous pack-of-lies speech made by Mr Gyurcsány. This makes it clear why the response was a two-thirds majority in the elections. Because the people who moved in these circles, as far as I am aware, were always very elegant and eloquent in handling our media and spoke several languages, they were also able to convey a picture of the country which, in my opinion, was a distortion of reality.

With regard to the three points, I have a question for the Commission concerning the national bank: When does it become a legal requirement for the central bank to be independent? I thought that had to be the case when a country joined the euro area. This implies that there is no obligation beforehand. Therefore, it is a political question as to whether or not a few structural changes are made on the way to joining. My specific question is therefore as follows: When does this obligation begin?

Secondly, as far as the independence of the data protection ombudsman is concerned, I would like to ask the Hungarian Government to compare its rules with those of other European countries. Institutional independence is an important value and this also involves only being able to replace the head of the institution in an exceptional situation.

Thirdly, I do not have any detailed information about the government’s intentions in reducing the retirement age from 70 to 62. However, I am certain about one thing and that is that a left-wing government with the same intentions would have celebrated this measure as a major socio-political feat and as a means of making way for the younger generation.</literal>

  –Mr President, today’s debate is not directed against the Hungarian people and does not only concern the situation in Hungary. The so-called ‘radical’ reforms implemented by the Orbán government are an act of provocation against European values and the Treaties on which a united Europe is based.

‘Orbán’ politics is testing the desire to combat authoritarianism, xenophobia, populism and the suspension of democracy. This model is not unique to Hungary. Apart from everything we have heard about Hungary, we have election rigging in Bulgaria in favour of the ruling party, brutal police tactics in Romania, the Roma in France or media freedom in Italy. This is the fault of Europe’s institutions.

If the European Commission had not been satisfied merely with cosmetic recommendations on the media law in Hungary, it would not be composing a second letter today in defence of their independence. We need a new pact, not only one for financial stability, but also a pact supporting the stability of democracy, because political crisis is the most awful after financial and economic crisis, as it is more serious and entails more terrible consequences.</literal>

  . –Mr President, in December, the European Commissioner, Ms Reding, sent the Hungarian Minister of Justice a letter requiring him to explain a certain number of things. Just a few hours later, the Hungarian Minister replied to this letter by means of a 19-page mail.

Having read all that, I get the feeling there are two ways of looking at things. However, what is clear is that, as the guardian of the Treaties, how the Commission sees things will prevail in a debate like this. I also note that, in recent days and weeks, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Orbán, and other representatives of Hungary have said that they are ready and willing to comply with the Commission’s verdict and to take part in the infringement proceedings. Objectively speaking, that is what is at stake, and not much else.

As for the rest, people are behaving as if something very sinister and terrible was going on in Hungary. Why? Because of some appointment or another that might become Central Bank policy. Is this really a massive violation of the human rights of the entire Hungarian population? Although in this case highly political, does the appointment of the data protection supervisor really equate to a violation of human rights of millions of Hungarians? I do not think so.

If there is reason to believe that such problems exist, we need to take a closer look at matters. That is what the Commission is doing. The Commission will tell us what its findings are and we will act accordingly, working alongside it more likely than not. However, acting as we are as if the most sinister totalitarianism were on its way back, under the pretext that some laws do not tally with Community law, this all seems a bit over the top in my opinion and, Mr Cohn-Bendit, you know this too.</literal>

  –Mr President, for more than a year the European Parliament has been complaining that antidemocratic abuses have been taking place not only in Hungary but also in Romania and Bulgaria, which openly conflict with European values, culture and legal regulations. For more than a year these actions have been accumulating, and the decision made by the Commission today to initiate infringement proceedings only serves to confirm that we were right to be concerned. For more than a year the role of the national parliament, opposition parties, trade unions and press freedom have been under attack not only in Hungary, but also in Romania. For more than a year the European Commission has either been timid or said nothing. Against this background, I ask you, Vice-President Reding, whether today President Barroso and yourself are part of the left-wing conspiracy which our colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have been feverishly talking about, or are you taking note of these actions? During these troubled times, I call for the Commission not to keep silent, but to act as guardian of the Treaties.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, reading the European papers in the past few weeks one could have been under the impression that even the bad weather was the fault of the Hungarian Government, not to mention the economic crisis. Today, however, we finally had the chance to continue the heated debate about Hungary on a democratic footing. Yesterday the Commission specified the three subjects in respect of which it expects the Hungarian Government’s cooperation in legal form as well. In response the Hungarian Prime Minister, demonstrating his commitment to democracy, came here to respond personally to the questions raised. It was up to us, to Parliament, to grow up to this task and to provide a framework and control for this dialogue. Today we therefore had the opportunity to conduct a debate that was about factually based arguments instead of seeking to induce hysteria. However, we seem to have missed this opportunity. Today it was demonstrated that many left-wing Members are more interested in continuing a campaign of accusations reminiscent of show trials than in a rational resolution of disputed matters. Today it once again became clear that the left-wing would rather strew false accusations all over this House than go through the trouble of learning the facts. Today it became apparent that many left-wing Members still hope that the democratic decision made by two-thirds of the Hungarian voters can be overruled in Brussels or in Strasbourg.

Ladies and gentlemen, the left-wing is attacking Hungary’s sovereignty and the popular government of the country, but we would do well to remember that in doing so they do the most damage to the common European idea. The left-wing hopes that it has found a Europe-wide model to weaken the popular model and that it can profit from this, but it is once again mistaken, because in truth what it does serves exclusively to fuel radical parties. Today, when the EU is going through the severest crisis in its history, this is unforgiveable irresponsibility.</literal>

  Mr President, we are discussing the demolition of democracy going on in Hungary. But a very similar path is being followed in Romania, and both situations closely resemble the patterns of the Berlusconi era in Italy.

In Romania we are facing an authoritarian populism that is altering the rule of law, concentrating power in the hands of the President. The mantra of this right-wing populism is the same in all cases. Its leaders believe that, since they won elections, they can do whatever they like with the constitutional structure of their country to tell the majority their mission is accomplished:. Populist leaders everywhere have the same targets: the parliament, the constitutional court, the judiciary, the so-called Leftist press.

It is outrageous to see a government in Romania using the police and the secret service to intimidate political opponents, restrict civil liberties and falsify elections. At the same time, public television has become an instrument of government propaganda and the Romanian press is considered a threat to national security, like terrorism and organised crime. It is equally outrageous to see political elections in an EU country organised by a body with a military structure like the spatial telecommunications service under the orders of Băsescu.

Thousands of people are demonstrating in the streets of every Romanian city against their government and to defend their basic rights. We should stand united, using all the instruments we have to counter this threat to the very foundation of our Union.</literal>

  –Mr President, thank you for allowing me to finish my speech, which was cut off earlier by mistake.

I was saying that focussing on these three points – the retirement age of judges, the independence of the central bank and the independence of the data protection authority – should not be used as an excuse to overlook the other constitutional changes. Nor should interest and reaction be confined to the question of the media and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, leaving aside other constitutional changes and threats to organised workers, such as the attacks on the Labour Code, which has been replaced by a new code which upsets the balance of workers’ rights in favour of employers.

Finally, the example of Hungary cannot be isolated from a more general framework which also concerns other Member States, the framework of the economic crisis and its side effects of unemployment and an uncertain future. As the guardian of the Treaties, the European Commission must also turn its attention to other Member States demonstrating a tendency towards cutting citizens’ rights.</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like to make the following point. We are not talking about the economic situation in Hungary. We are also not discussing the previous communist regime in Hungary. We are not talking about either of these things, nor about the financial crisis or other subjects. In fact we are talking about the fact that Hungary, as a member of the EU, has moved away from being a state under the rule of law. That is what this is all about and there is no doubt that Hungary has done away with the values of the European Union using legislation. That is the other factor compared with other countries.

It is not only the independence of the central bank and of the judiciary which has been abolished. We need to remember that the general right to take legal action has also been removed. The highest judges are no longer the guardians of the constitution. That is scandalous and it primarily affects the individual right to take legal action. All of these things represent a violation of EU values. The only question which we need to discuss today is: What are we doing? In contrast to other speakers, I am not calling for treaty infringement proceedings to be instituted, as the Commission wants. Instead, I would like to see Article 7 applied, because this situation involves a clear risk of a serious breach of the fundamental values of the EU.</literal>

  –Mr President, Mr Orbán, ladies and gentlemen, some of the criticisms made against your government in the last few months are genuine, but the majority are clearly instrumental and ideological. We have had proof of this today, because you have come to Parliament and offered to provide the explanations required, which is clear proof that you can be trusted to act democratically.

However, some have continued to protest, showing that they are in bad faith, have no interest in hearing what you have to say, and are motivated by ideological reasons alone. It is no coincidence that those protesting today are the children and grandchildren of the regime which in 1949 imposed the constitution that you and your government have finally removed. Perhaps even here there are those who miss it.

I have also learned that one of the problems some Members are concerned about is the retirement age of judges in Hungary. Should we have a special session on this? Should we look at the retirement age for judges in all the Member States? The logical consequence of this is that we should apply the penalties of Article 7 to countries where they retire before the age of 62, whereas countries where they retire after the age of 62 are democratic. We are bordering on the ridiculous Mr President …</literal>

It is also in our interest to base our judgment on real facts that have been examined objectively. The more assured we are that the criticism levelled against a Member State reflects reality, the better it is for objective debate. For that reason, I would like to call on the Commission to ask the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights to shed some light on the matter for us, not just today, but every time we are faced with such cases. It certainly would be beyond comprehension to have a European agency authorised to deal with human rights remaining silent when those very rights are blatantly being violated.

May I ask the Commission to commit to asking the Agency, firstly to give it its opinion on the matter and, secondly, to ensure that it is published?</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like at this moment to point out another problem that is very significant but that has been mentioned very little so far, and that is the problem that, under the new constitution, which is criticised here for lack of democracy, room has been made for another very destabilising step, and that is the granting of the right to vote to minorities living in neighbouring countries. This was preceded by the granting of Hungarian citizenship to minorities, but this would not be out of the ordinary if the Hungarian citizenship were granted on the basis of someone’s permanent residency, family ties or work in the country. But the citizenship is granted on the basis of a purely ethnic principle, and this ethnic principle is causing destabilisation across the region. I firmly believe that the Commission, too, will soon have a problem with this. I am surprised that my colleagues from the EPP have not noticed this, because it is an atmosphere of nationalism that is prevailing in Hungary today, and it is a nationalism that is fixated on the past, on the 19th century, rather than dealing with matters in a positive way.</literal>

The European institutions, currently so preoccupied with the sustainability of our economies, must also concern themselves with the sustainability of our democracies. This is not, as a Member from the PPE Group said here, an unprecedented debate. To the contrary, it is the European debate; it is the debate that shapes us all. Do not, therefore, tell us that this is a debate for the Commission either. The Commission has confirmed technical procedures that are offences and the Council does have the ability to use Article 7(2) as a ‘red card’, but Parliament does not use the whole of Article 7. Parliament has the right to use Article 7(1), which is a ‘yellow card’ rather than a ‘red card’. This represents a warning system where there is a risk of breaches of fundamental rights.

I am sure that their intellectual and political honesty means that our follow Members will allow us to go and check on the ground whether or not use of the ‘yellow card’ of Article 7(1) is justified.</literal>

With astonishment we observe the hypocrisy of the European Commission, which reacts so drastically in the case of Hungary, while in Poland, for example, the ruling coalition, using the authority of the National Broadcasting Council which is subordinate to it, deliberately blocks broadcasting by certain television stations which are inconvenient to it, such as the Catholic television station Trwam, on digital platforms. Since the current Polish Government is so enthusiastically inclined toward the Union’s institutions, the Commission simply turns a blind eye to discriminatory practises even though they violate fundamental values of the European Union. In the case of Hungary, whose government enjoys the support of an overwhelming majority of its citizens, the Commission, however, uses selective blackmail.

I would like to make a few brief comments. I am pleased that you are prepared to admit, at least to a certain extent, that you have made mistakes and that some of your laws need to be amended. The laws which require amendment are important ones.

You underestimate the importance of Hungary and of the development of Hungary for democracy. That is the decisive issue. We are not criticising Hungary, but your policy. The President of this House has already said this and I would put it even more strongly: do not misuse religion for political purposes. Whatever our religious conviction is, we combine religion with tolerance. Religion without tolerance is not acceptable, whether it is Islam or a Christian religion. This is the decisive factor.

Finally, you spoke about the family. We all belong to families. As you are well aware, my family comes partly from Hungary and partly from the Czech Republic. Therefore, my family is Europe.

European values are not Christian values. European values are freedom of conscience, freedom to believe in a religion of one’s choice, freedom to believe or not to believe.

The second thing I wanted to say, Mr Orbán, is that attacking the Hungarian Government, criticising the Hungarian Government’s policy, is not criticising Hungary, it is not picking on Hungary and it is not picking on the Hungarian people. Sadly, we know exactly what the nationalist tendencies of those who talk like that are.

The other thing I wanted to say is that you have invited us all to read the Hungarian Constitution. Unfortunately, I do not speak Hungarian. I know that some translation work has been done.

Finally, Mr Orbán, I really hope that many of us get to go to Hungary. I certainly will be going. I will be talking with Hungarian society, with the representatives of Hungarian civil society and with anyone willing to talk to me.

As part of a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I also hope that many of us get to go there, as you have invited us, to look at what is actually being done.</literal>

If it is not working properly, the democrats are there to listen, to move things forward and change. You have all been to Hungary, as have I. For the time being, you can still move freely in Hungary and I do believe that we will be able to move around Hungary for a very long time to come. Politics is politics, but in Hungary there is freedom of movement.

Yet it is true that it is not just Hungary facing the current difficulties; we are all facing them. This applies to the whole of Europe. The current crisis will increase the number of poor and I do not think that it is the Hungarian Government at fault for this. Nor would I accuse the governments of yesteryear blaming them for the deficits. We all have a duty to find the solutions. I am sure that here we are looking for solutions with Viktor Orbán, as he is no Chavez – a name which it pains me to use here in this debate, in a democracy, in a democratic house, this is one step too far and not normal. He is here, even if he is not perfect. Who is perfect? Let he who is perfect cast the first stone. I think that together we will find a solution.</literal>

               –Many of the speeches in our long debate have been rather generic. It has not been clearly shown which provisions of the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have been violated by Hungary, or which precise provision of Hungarian law should be censured. Only the Commission has indicated three more precise areas for investigation. I believe that in this regard we need to have faith in the Commission and in the Hungarian Government and Parliament. However, there is an underlying issue that needs to be brought to light. Attacks continue to be made on the Hungarian Constitution, but no one has the courage to indicate the real reasons why a certain European radical left-wing is supporting a campaign of denigration against a country which has great merit in the fight for democracy and freedom. What is disturbing about the Hungarian Constitution is the reference to Christian roots, recognition of human dignity from the moment of conception, and statement that the family is a natural state based on marriage between a man and a woman. I do not believe that these three aspects conflict with European values. In fact they are an exemplary description of the foundations of such values, which should be taken as a model by all of European law.</literal>

The not-too-distant past has shown us the danger that arises when these two factors come together: poverty caused by recession and nationalist tendencies. European history still bears the burden of totalitarian regimes whose actions recklessly crushed people’s destinies. The European project, founded on democracy, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights, is being undermined in Hungary by the recent decisions adopted by the government to amend the constitution arbitrarily. A state which claims to be democratic cannot curb fundamental freedoms, cannot gag the press and cannot restrict the independence of the central bank. Unfortunately, Hungary is not the only state where the government is violating citizens’ rights. In Romania, thousands of people are currently out in the streets protesting against the abuses and incompetence of the Băsescu regime and to protect their constitutional right to elect their leaders by a free vote during early elections, at a time when the current government no longer represents them. It is the European institutions’ duty to punish such abuses severely to avoid history repeating itself.</literal>

               –From the very moment it came to power, the Hungarian Government has been persisting in promoting policies that conflict with European law and have a strong nationalist-populist aspect. Both the media law and certain provisions of the new constitution or the new law concerning the organisation and management of the central bank prove that the right-wing government in Budapest is deliberately challenging the Communityand democratic principles, even though a whole series of international and European organisations, including the European Parliament, have reiterated their serious concerns regarding the undemocratic tendencies of the policies promoted by it.

In this context, I welcome the decision made by the European Commission to initiate proceedings against Hungary for infringing the Treaties. However, I hope that this process will not remain at this initial stage, but will definitely continue if the government in Budapest fails to comply with EU law as soon as possible.

At the same time, the Commission should also take a stance against similar infringements of democratic principles in Romania and Bulgaria, countries where there is a steady decline in European values under the impact of the antisocial policies promoted by right-wing governments.</literal>

Hungary’s case is not unique in the European Union, yet we are treated with increased attention whatever we may do. The debate has shown quite well that left-wing speakers are rather lacking in terms of factual accuracy, which, however, does not seem to disturb even their leading orators. It is a fact that over the past two years there has been a reform in my country of such a magnitude that it should have been undertaken already at the time of Hungary’s democratic transition. This is exactly what the voters authorised the Government to do. I can sympathise with those who have suffered grievances, but the methods through which they seek recompense are unacceptable to me. If I recall correctly, when we acceded to the European Union we did not choose to completely surrender our country’s sovereignty in all matters, but to fulfil our jointly undertaken commitments. I indicated already during the debate on the presentation of the Danish Presidency programme that putting Hungary in a pillory will not bring about a satisfactory resolution of the euro area debt crisis. If we were to spend as much time on crisis management or the protection of the euro as we are spending on Hungary, we may already have succeeded in resolving our problems. It is unbecoming that in this period of European crisis we are looking for scapegoats and in the meantime divert attention from the fact that another intergovernmental agreement is about to be concluded in complete disregard for the Community method.</literal>

Unfortunately, Hungary is not heading in this direction and is not alone in this in Eastern Europe. The argument for reforms in Hungary revolves around the new constitution. The fundamental law was amended after 1989, marking an almost radical move away from the 1949 version. The argument that this constitution needed to be changed because it was Stalinist does not stack up in this context. Hungary is going through major changes. It is not possible to talk about reform when democratic principles are being violated. A series of laws have been adopted, targeting the whole judicial system and the independence of the central bank. They are moving Hungary away from European values. Similar scenarios can also be encountered in Romania and Bulgaria. In times of crisis, populist arguments which actually provide the basis for such governments cannot be accepted. I have said it before and will repeat it: regimes that move away from democracy must be brought up for discussion at European level. Romanians, Bulgarians and Hungarians must be protected from politicians of the likes of Orbán, Băsescu or Borisov.</literal>

As the only Roma Member of the EP, I firmly reject such accusations and I would like to remind everyone that Fidesz was the only European party to send a Roma MEP to the European Parliament and three Roma representatives to the Hungarian Parliament. The government prioritised developing an EU-level strategy for Roma inclusion, the successful adoption of which was appreciated by the vast majority of this House. Prime Minister Orbán signed an unprecedented cooperation agreement with the National Roma Self-Government, presenting quantified and clear targets, and Hungary was the first to submit to the Commission its comprehensive national strategy for Roma inclusion. I was therefore astonished that some of my fellow MEPs stated without the slightest evidence that Hungarian Roma are afraid. There is of course a significant anti-Roma sentiment throughout Europe, but to blame it on a government that has been in office for less than two years is another example of the political misuse and abuse of the Roma issue, which I firmly reject.</literal>

I am convinced that the procedure begun by the Commission will lead to legal clarity on this issue.

What is the reason for a Central European EU Member State whose conservative government successfully filled the EU’s Presidency last year becoming so important? I find the barrage that has been levelled at Hungary for some time now unacceptable from a political and even from an ethical standpoint. The unfounded and overly politically motivated accusations directed by this House at the Hungarian Government should be rejected. In the present economic and social situation which is marked by a crisis the EU should offer support and a reliable background to its own Member States. It is therefore inappropriate to launch political attacks against a Member State that has come to be in a difficult economic situation. Hungary has undertaken to comply with the legislative amendments urged by the European Commission, because it considers respect for EU values and the Community legal order to be essential. It is only those who do not know the country and its leaders who call this fact into question. The oft-mentioned principle of solidarity should apply to all Member States equally. The use of double standards should be condemned in all such cases. A significant majority of Hungarian voters support the right-wing conservative government to this day. The left-wing and liberal media, engaged in an unprecedented campaign against the Hungarian civic state, remain silent about this, and also for example about the peace marches organised in support of the government. An equitable judgement – this is what the seasoned democracy of Hungary deserves and expects.</literal>

Weakening the independence of a central bank may breach the provisions of Article 130 of the TFUE, which provide that when performing their duties, central banks shall not receive instructions from governments of Member States, and these in turn agree not to influence members of the former’s governing bodies. However, we must not forget that the EU is a community of sovereign states, which have the right to self-determination within the limits of the commitments made in the Treaties. In case of doubt concerning the compatibility of national legislation with the, there is a procedure according to which a Member State may submit its interpretation. We should appreciate the open communications strategy of Prime Minister Orbán and his willingness to listen to the arguments of the European institutions. The main focus of our recent discussions has been the debt crisis, but we must not forget about the values upon which the European Community was built. In this context, attention should be drawn to the fact that while some so vigorously criticise Hungary for violating the Treaties, at the same time we are dealing with attempts to undermine the primacy of European law through intergovernmental agreement, and there is no similar debate regarding this issue, even though objectively it is equally important.</literal>

One can always find one-sided justifications for different measures that the government is taking and the methods it is pursuing, but at the moment these justifications do not reflect the democratic values that we stand for as Europeans. It seems that Mr Orbán has forgotten that democracy is not only the rule of the majority, but also the respect and protection of the minority. It is also important to understand that Hungary, as a Member State, has an obligation to follow the principles enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union and thus have its legislation adhere to the TEU, the TFEU and other international treaties and obligations. I sincerely hope that Mr Orbán can comprehend our reservations and will act accordingly to re-route Hungary away from becoming an autocratic country and back onto the track of democracy. I must reiterate that the situation in Hungary is not an internal matter of the Member State, but it is a concern for all of us, since the Treaties are being disregarded.</literal>

Now it is the independence of the Hungarian central bank, the independence of the judiciary and the independence of the national data protection authority that are under threat. Viktor Orbán once fought against communist totalitarianism; Hungary is now part of the Union and there are fundamental values to be respected. The European Union fights for democracy and human rights worldwide. What is the logic in supporting the Arab revolutions, on the one hand, while allowing a Member State to undermine its own democracy.

I listen to the statements of the left in this House, read the articles in the Western press, look at TV reports on Hungary and Hungarians, and I entirely fail to recognise myself in what they say. The mirror that is being held up is a distorting one; it shows an imagined Hungary, born of the dystopic fantasies of the Western left. This selfsame left has referred more than once to European values. The one that I miss is that of fairness, of listening to the views of the other side. Nor is there much evidence of moderation or reason in what is being marshalled against Hungary; it adds up mostly to wild exaggeration and hyperbole. But this campaign, this onslaught against Hungary is not without its unintended consequences. Opinion in Hungary does not recognise itself in the distorting mirror and it resents what it does see. And that resentment is directed at the left, not at the government. It is directed at those who are seen as traducing Hungary, Hungary’s European credentials and the very European values in the name of which the left claims to be acting.</literal>

The Commission gave Hungary one month to implement changes.

In addition, the Hungarian democracy has a clear problem relating to respect for minorities, rights guaranteed to the opposition, and media pluralism. I am grateful to Hungarian society for so vocally expressing its views and opinions, and sometimes criticism, which I listen to attentively. It is not possible to ‘bind’ matters of public debate, such as tax policies, by basic law, even if they are the best solutions. The public has a right to seek changes in relation to such matters. Democracy is the rule of the majority, but minorities must also be respected, and therefore we should all take a close look at the Magyars and put pressure on their rulers to go back on these changes, which are harmful to democracy.

The Prime Minister of Hungary should not have to act as an advocate of his country, which has been put in a pillory, but should be among us as a guest of honour of the European Parliament. However, I am convinced that not so far from now there will come a time when, as Havel, he too will be greeted in accordance with his merits as a prominent personage of the Hungarian democratic transition. Those who are trying to put Hungary and the head of its government, Viktor Orbán, on a wall of shame, have no idea about the period and nature of the fight against the communists who clawed their way back into power twice after 1994. It is, first of all, Viktor Orbán and hisParty to whom the imperishable merit for rising up from a defeated position and making the communists fall once and for all in an act comparable to a second change of regime belongs. In today’s Hungary the post-communist regime that was vetoed by a two-thirds majority of Hungarian voters continues its rear-guard struggle against the national public will and seeks to make the efforts of a democratically elected Orbán Government impossible in both the internal and the foreign political arena. I am quite familiar with the anatomy of counter-revolutionary communist restoration from Romania’s case. It is an indication of the maladjusted condition and moral crisis of the European Union, which is beset by a complex crisis, that instead of far-reaching solidarity and support it exposes a Hungary ruined by socialists and pseudo-liberals to infringement procedures and undeserved prosecution.

Of course, we need to continue to move forward in Europe and we must not relax our efforts. However, we must, of course, also explain this to the Council, which did not show as much commitment to some of the issues in Durban as I would have liked. I went to Durban with slightly higher expectations and I must admit that I came home feeling a little more hopeful than when I left. We do now have the Durban Platform, which was one of the Commission’s fundamental initiatives and I would like to give my sincere thanks to you and your team. This now forms the basis for a global climate agreement, which we must work very hard on in the years up to 2015.

Unfortunately, we did not manage to expand the single-track Kyoto 2 route. It still only covers 15%. However, it is clear that we are now in a position to say that the world climate map has changed significantly. We no longer have the simple division between Kyoto and non-Kyoto countries. States like China and the US can no longer fall back on the ridiculous arguments that they have used over the last 10 years and say that if someone else is not doing something, then they will not do it either. This was genuinely embarrassing in Copenhagen and Cancún, but the situation had improved in Durban. We now have a new world order and the Commission has shown great commitment in helping to develop it.

We will now all have to travel in the same direction. There is no other option. Some countries will be slower than others. I like to compare this situation with that of a tunnel. We all know where the end is, but we still have to build the individual stations and stopping places. You are right in saying that we and the Commission will all have to work hard on this.

I would like to give you, Ms Hedegaard, my very warm congratulations. I have always been happy to do this. You made a very important contribution in Durban, but the Council did not. I will be taking the Council to task about this again later today. You have established important milestones and we will be happy to go on supporting you along this route.</literal>

               . –Mr President, Ms Hedegaard, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would also like to congratulate you on your handling of the negotiations in Durban. The EU has demonstrated its strong leadership skills and this has paid off. I am also pleased about the climate diplomacy and the coalition of 120 states. I would like to see China joining our strategic coalition, alongside Africa. China is moving towards taking over worldwide responsibility. This would send out a signal to the US to bring an end to its policy of denial and to join the mainstream of international climate policy.

We have prevented a fiasco and we have produced the road map which we will have to work on. There is, of course, a great deal for us to do at home. We have the gigatonne gap and if Europe wants to play a leading role, it will have to do more than it has in the past. I hope that there will be new initiatives which go beyond 20%. We must take the hot air out of Kyoto 2. The policy cannot really be credible with all these surplus certificates.

I would like to encourage you to remain tough in the areas of aviation and shipping and to take new initiatives. It is totally absurd that the US Congress can pass a law banning airlines from taking part in our legislation. We must not allow this to happen and Parliament would like to see you maintaining your tough stance.</literal>

               –Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by congratulating you and thanking you for the work that you personally carried out in Durban, which in effect led to an almost binding agreement and did so – and here echo the words spoken somewhat less diplomatically by Mr Lorenz – despite extremely strong reluctance on the part of the Polish Presidency on certain points. Well done also for standing firm on including aviation in the ETS despite threats from the United States and China.

We have made some progress. It was not as great as we would have liked and we now know that there is very little chance of us getting greenhouse gas emissions restricted to two points, as we were promised. In these talks, it was governments, particularly those of the United States and Canada, which still fail to recognise the significance of the risk we face. However, although it has made some considerable effort on the domestic front, China also put up some resistance.

The role played by the oil and gas lobbies has also been extremely negative and we cannot help but be concerned about the next COP being held in Qatar, a State that is one of the major emitters of greenhouse gases per capita on the planet and that, moreover, denies civil society, trade unions, NGOs and women of their rights. This is a truly appalling symbol for something so important.

Progress will only be possible if progress is also made in terms of global governance. This year should then be the perfect opportunity to do so by building on the progress already made, particularly with regard to the least developed countries.

I shall finish by saying that we, in Europe, must also adopt this proactive approach that we have seen in Durban. This is not just about climate protection. It is in the interest of the European economy and we must fight to be or stay, depending on circumstance, at the forefront of the transition to a green economy. This goal can only become a reality in the months ahead and of course, Commissioner, you have our full support for going down this road.</literal>

               Mr President, I would, first of all, like to congratulate Commissioner Hedegaard on the role she played in Durban on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. We demonstrated there that, if Europe works together and speaks with one voice, we can, indeed, make a difference on the world stage. To my mind, this was the most important result of Durban: to show that Europe can make a difference. So, thank you very much for that.

However, there remains much to be done, because we all know that we have, in fact, not moved much further forward when it comes to climate change. The gap between the two degree target that we committed ourselves to and the reduction that we promised by 2020 is still gigantic. We are still only heading towards three to four degrees. That is still a huge climate change problem and we should not be putting it off until 2020. You are right when you say that we still have a great deal of work to do between 2012 and 2015.

What matters most to the Group of the Greens? Building on our alliance with the least developed countries and the low-lying islands. They have opted to side with Europe and we should keep them firmly on our side in the forthcoming period, in order to maintain pressure on China and India. These countries need a credible trade policy and a credible technology policy. Europe will have to be very consistent on that score.

Talking of credibility: Europe itself will also have to pull out all the stops in order to demonstrate that we mean to act. That means a step towards -30% – leaked studies show that that will also save money – and the set-aside. That is the decision that was made by the European Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, in December. The Committee should now really take the initiative to this end. We can take action. We have to, for the sake of the climate.</literal>

               Mr President, for a treaty on climate change to be meaningful, all the major emitters in the world must be a part of it. The Durban Platform gives us a roadmap for a binding legal treaty to combat climate change. Everyone in the world, including the major emitters – the United States, India and China – must be committed to this goal.

The roadmap gives us a realistic timetable to negotiate a new agreement by 2015. The reason Durban was successful? Because it is not overly ambitious. It is not an ‘all or nothing’ summit like Copenhagen. Also, the European negotiators and the British negotiating team were able to persuade a broad coalition of countries to commit to commit. Richer developing countries have agreed to do their bit, and the poorest countries will receive assistance to cope with climate change through a green climate fund. I hope the EU will continue with this positive approach.</literal>

               –Mr President, Commissioner, let us be clear: there is no way to ‘sugar the pill’. The result of Durban is a Kyoto Protocol weakened even further, covering less than one fifth of world greenhouse gas emissions. Given the history we have, to conclude now – as the Durban Platform does – that important decisions will be made in the future does not even justify optimistic discourse.

Regrettably, only one thing seems to be containing an even greater increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere: the deepening crisis of capitalism, the recession and the consequent decline in economic activity. It is in this context that it would be even more important – that it is even more important – to change profoundly the approach we have been making to the problem of climate change. Specifically, we need to call into question the so-called flexibility instruments and carbon trading.

We shall leave you with a question, Commissioner: how can you guarantee that we will not have, in the place of investment in low-carbon technologies, a situation of business as usual, underwritten by the purchase of the emissions licences of those unable to make use of them.</literal>

  –Mr President, the experience of all the climate change conferences held since 1995 tells us that, in their present format, they are doomed to failure.

They sought a global agreement and, furthermore, sought to arrive at it by a consensus, an impossible ambition to achieve because of the very different productive, economic and social structure of the states concerned. That is why, in the end, what they can hope to achieve are minimum threholds, but clearly this is not enough.

Furthermore, climate change is linked to other deep-rooted problems in societies, such as their development and education models, social differences and poverty. If all of these issues are to be raised at these conferences, it will be even more difficult for agreements to be reached, especially if the conferences turn into fairs, international exhibitions, with thousands and thousands of participants, which has been the case.

The European Union must continue to fly the flag for the environment, which Commissioner Hedegaard did very well in Durban. For that, I congratulate her. These conferences, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, need greater coherence between the states, more diplomatic work and less of a festival atmosphere.</literal>

  –Mr President, when I look at the almost empty Chamber and compare the situation with the previous debate, with the emotion and the heat that the subject generated, and when I think about the importance of climate change for every individual person in Europe and, most importantly, for the population of the world as a whole, I find it very sad. Unfortunately, it demonstrates that this subject is gradually slipping off the political agenda. The Members who are here have all tried to do our best. Some of us attended the conference in Durban and you, Ms Hedegaard, accomplished a great deal there. I would like to compliment you on having reached an agreement and established the Durban Platform under these circumstances.

It was very difficult for me. We were fighting against a headwind from all directions. It came in particular from China, from the US and from India, but nevertheless we Europeans took on the role that we have always assigned ourselves. Everything will now depend on how the next few years go and on whether we can really achieve the goal that we have set ourselves of a binding worldwide agreement in 2015. It is up to us to convince the other states that action is needed.

We now have a consensus among most of the countries in Europe that climate change will help the economy and that we must remain competitive, but that we must do this by investing in climate-related technologies. There is a strong awareness of this in most states. We can make progress by building on this foundation. These are the only arguments which the major polluters, such as China and the US, will understand. Unfortunately, their concern about the welfare of the world’s population has been put on the back burner.

I would like to ask you in the near future to submit the proposal about F-gas emissions that you have promised us and to include aviation. Please could you also investigate what we can do with regard to tropospheric ozone and soot particles, so that we have a comprehensive strategy. Once again, Ms Hedegaard, I would like to congratulate you on what you have achieved in Durban.</literal>

  –Mr President, Ms Hedegaard, many of us always praise you when you are here in Parliament because you always take the lead in the fight against climate change and always support a very progressive and ambitious line. You did this in Durban, too, but I am nevertheless critical of the results. I would even go so far as to say that I think Durban was a fiasco. The reason I say this is as follows: the fact that we could not achieve anything better than a legal obligation to reduce COemissions in 2020 does not mean that we should accept that. The problem with doing that is that, by doing so, we have in fact said to the rest of the world that we accept the fact that we will not have anything legally binding that can keep us below the 2 degree target before 2020. Everyone sitting in this Chamber and everyone following this debate via the web streaming or by other means and who is interested in the climate knows that this will be too late.

If we are to keep the temperature rise to less than 2 degrees – and we must do that because if we go beyond 2 degrees there are a whole series of positive feedback effects that will kick in and then the process will be irreversible and we will not be able to do anything – we need to start within 5 years. All science indicates this, the International Energy Agency says this and it is difficult to find people who understand this matter who do not agree with this. That is why it was a fiasco, and therefore we need to say that we can no longer concentrate on solving this problem from the top down via the United Nations. There is now only one way to go about this and that is from the bottom up, and you also need to play a part in this.</literal>

  Mr President, the Commissioner’s achievement of a deal on an agreement with legal force by 2015 is a significant step in the development of responsible stewardship for our planet. To me, the significance of Durban lies not just in an agreement between governments, but in a consensus among the peoples of the world in that great tented city outside the conference hall, speaking many tongues, but with one global language of common concern. Their sense of urgency needs to be matched by government action.

Our greatest ally may yet be the world’s largest emitter of CO– China’s recent second national assessment report on climate change warns its government that action is urgently needed. The Union must work with China to build a coalition of the willing to hand down a healthy planet to future generations.

The recent IPCC report on extreme weather events ought to convince the USA and Canada. What can the Commission do to counter the detestable and irresponsible behaviour on their part that imperils humankind and bring them into the new alliance?

Among all the praise for the Durban Platform, please remember that a halo is only ever 25 centimetres from being a noose. We must change our action in the European Union. Commissioner, we know what we need to do. We have the technology to do it. Our Union will be judged by how fast it can muster the political will.</literal>

               Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to add my congratulations to the Commissioner for her work at Durban. In terms of diplomacy, Durban was a breakthrough, and continental plates moved. As has already been mentioned in this debate, a timetable agreed from the scientific perspective is a solution that is much too slow to prevent the catastrophic acceleration of climate change.

At Durban, the EU persuaded almost all the other participants to agree to take an additional step. Now it is time to step up our own climate measures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is urging industrialised countries to cut emissions by 25% at least by 2020. Our legislation says that the figure is just 20%. Our emissions targets have to bemore stringent. The hot air at Kyoto needs to be eliminated. We must obtain criteria for biofuels to prevent natural forests from becoming biofuel plantations. Tar sand and other dirty new sources of fossil fuel should be treated as the dirty options that they are. Emissions from shipping should be subject to restrictions. In short, we need to have more stringent measures in place to ensure that global warming does not exceed two degrees.</literal>

  –Mr President, I think that after Durban we can be sure of one thing. We can be sure that we are alone in the world as concerns our ideas on emission reduction. The extension of the operation of the Kyoto Protocol is only an illustration of this impasse. I think that instead of beating our head against a wall, we should revise our climate policy so that its costs are distributed more equitably.

Moving on into the next phase of the emission trading scheme in 2013 will entail in Poland, for instance, being under even greater pressure to transfer paper, glass, and cement production outside the Union. In crisis conditions, the climate policy is a millstone around the neck of European industry, which will eventually be relocated to countries that are our direct competitors. The European Union, in pursuing such a radical climate policy alone, without global agreement, brings upon itself responsibility for economic slowdown.</literal>

  –Mr President, the lack of agreement in Durban is a fact which the Commission should take note of. The Commissioner should take this fact into consideration in her decisions and other activities, because policies should be rational, pragmatic and predictable and lead to a clear goal.

Climate policy can only be rational when looked at from a global perspective. Greenhouse gases know no borders, so if it is a fact that Canada pulled right out of the Kyoto Protocol in Durban, if it is a fact that other countries that are major emitters, including China, do not wish to decide to significantly reduce emissions jointly with Europe, it means that our policy is Quixotic, that it is not effective, that even if we managed to reduce the limits, as proposed by the Commissioner and the Commission, this would not achieve the intended purpose in terms of impact on the global climate.

The policy makes sense only if there is a global agreement. If an effect of the policy in Europe is that our economy becomes less competitive in relation to less developed countries, and industry relocates to those countries, and with it jobs, then the consequences for our economy will be fatal. In Poland alone, according to estimates for 2013-2020, this will entail a loss of 250 000 jobs. Meanwhile energy bills will increase by 30-40% from 2013. This may lead to a crisis in the European Union as well as in relation to the European Union. This is very bad news, Commissioner. We need to take these actual facts into consideration.</literal>

  Mr President, in discussing Durban, the most obvious question is whether an agreement last year to reach an agreement in three years’ time to do something in eight years’ time is really an agreement at all.

Likewise, one has to ask whether the agreement to create a green climate fund and transfer USD 1 billion a year from hard-pressed taxpayers in countries like Britain to corrupt third world oligarchies reflects a serious threat of global communism or a happily unattainable fantasy. Given the way in which EU Commissioners are forcing economically suicidal spending cuts on the protectorates of Greece and Italy – a move likely to spark a chain-reaction implosion of the entire financial system – the fantasy answer is fortunately the more realistic.

But the most significant thing about Durban is what was not discussed: climate science. This is no surprise, as it is now crystal clear that the so-called scientific consensus on man-made global warming simply does not exist. It is not just a matter of the thousands of independent scientists who dispute the whole theory: even the warmists themselves now admit that the computer models on which the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) cult is based are simplistic and flawed. The more they learn about feedback mechanisms and the complexity of real climate, the more they realise they do not know. To crucify our taxpayers and de-industrialise our economies in pursuit of the one-world government madness of the United Nations is therefore crazy.

Hence the failure of 10 000 well-meaning tax-eaters to agree anything serious in Durban is to be warmly applauded.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have the time to go into detail or to enter into discussion about the major systems, but I think we have to acknowledge that some issues remain highly critical.

I share the concern about this Green Fund. At a time like this, where we will find the resources remains a mystery and a major concern. However I believe that in order to be realistic, we have to recognise that this time things changed at Durban. The old set-up that no longer reflected the actual global geopolitical situation was finally laid to rest. We had continued to work on a snapshot of the world in the 1990s that had been superseded for some time, and that, used as a basis for the forecasts to 2050, had become truly unsustainable.

Looking at 2050 we can see that the world’s top 30 economies will probably include 19 countries that are currently classified as developing countries. I believe that this change of pace was perhaps the most interesting piece of information from a political point of view, and in fact this was correctly emphasised by Mr Florenz.

I also think that we should no longer proceed as separate, watertight entities. Therefore, bearing in mind also the words of Mario Draghi, governor of the European Central Bank, in the House the other day, if we want to push for the priorities of growth and employment in this sector as well, we must be consistent and focus on green technologies in order to deliver sustainable development and to respond to our citizens’ most important needs.</literal>

I was pleased about the decision to negotiate a world climate agreement within the next three years with the aim of reducing emissions of harmful greenhouse gases, which will include for the first time the major emerging economies, such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa. The second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol from 2013 onwards was another step in the right direction. It is also important to mention the Green Climate Fund, which will have funding of USD 100 billion up to 2020. However, leading scientists are predicting global warming of at least 3.5 degrees, with consequences that we are well aware of.

Certainly, if we take a political view, the conference was a great success, since it represents a major step towards global responsibility, while the European Union once again played a leading role in this area and I sincerely congratulate you for the strategy you developed and also for your performance at the negotiations. Of course, those who judge the conference from the viewpoint of reducing greenhouse gas emissions cannot - we cannot - be satisfied. Here I am thinking of the biggest polluters, such as the United States, China, India, Japan and Russia. We met many representatives of these countries and actually I did not get the impression these representatives really wanted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I think a massive task still lies ahead of us to try to gain the support of these countries. We are particularly lacking in support from developed countries. In addition, I would like to see a future agreement reached on a uniform system for calculating emissions, because without this, we do not really know what numbers we are talking about or what these numbers mean. In the future, I also want to see more progress in the field of maritime and air transport, and of course, more ambition on the part of countries. We said that our goal was 2 degrees Celsius. Now we have 4 degrees Celsius, while scientists are warning us that we should be aiming for at least one and a half degrees. Thank you.</literal>

I am more and more convinced that it is by demonstrating ourselves that it is possible to switch, that it pays to switch and that switching will result in more jobs, that we can get others on board.

Precisely the opposite is true, however, and that is what Europe needs to demonstrate. Then we can get others on board.

You yourself mentioned an improved and extended cooperation with the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), and I also believe that this cooperation that you initiated with the least developed countries of the world (LDCs) is extremely important in order to prevent China from hiding behind them all the time on the international stage.

  –Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the agreement reached in Durban, where the EU was the major player, and I would take this opportunity to congratulate you on how you conducted the work, Commissioner.

The EU proposed a roadmap to a comprehensive agreement that would replace the Kyoto Protocol. The agreement, known as the Durban Platform, will be negotiated by 2015, to come into force in 2020.

A new era started in Durban. For the first time we will have an era of a new multilateralism, in which the commitments of all the industrialised and developing countries will have the same legal value. As it is flexible, the Durban Platform represents an opportunity for the European Union to reconcile combating climate change with economic growth.

Decision was also reached in Durban on a second compliance period for the Kyoto Protocol, so as to ensure continuity between the protocol and its successor.</literal>

  –Mr President, it is likely that this is the most important issue we could discuss in the European Parliament, as we are talking about the world’s future. In relation to the conference in Durban, I suppose we could view the glass as being half-full or half-empty. I view the glass as half-full, as we have made unexpected progress.

Global warming is obviously a global problem and needs a global solution. We have to work in particular towards the target of keeping global warming down to less than 2% and at least an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In relation to Europe, we have to lead by example, particularly in relation to reaching the 2020 targets for renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy savings, and to show, as Commissioner Hedegaard herself said on 7 November in Brussels, that green and growth go together. It then becomes a no-brainer for the rest of the world.

On the broader front we have to tackle the big offenders: aviation, shipping and deforestation. In relation to deforestation in particular, we have to ensure that our trade policies do not encourage deforestation, particularly in the Mercosur countries. Nevertheless, we have made progress.</literal>

  –Mr President, we can perhaps say that the success of the UN climate conference in Durban was that we agreed to agree. The strong words and declarations of the participants before the start of the UN conference did not translate into concrete ambitious and legally binding resolutions. Although the final text of the universal convention is expected in 2015, it is not expected to become legally binding until 2020, that is to say, in eight years’ time. Many world powers, which are also the largest polluters, thus left the conference feeling satisfied that they had avoided the new global rules. It appears that the European Union delegation was not sufficiently prepared to push through its objectives and force countries such as the United States, Russia, China, India and Brazil to actively engage in global strategies to combat climate change, and I am truly sorry about this.</literal>

  –Mr President, the European Union presented at the Durban Conference a clear agenda for reducing emissions, which remained on the discussion table for the entire duration of the conference.

No post-Kyoto agreement was signed, but the Kyoto Protocol was extended and a road map set up to 2015.

However, the Durban Platform objectives such as economic growth compatible with climate change and combating poverty are fairly ambiguous. How will industry be treated as part of combating climate change? An eco-efficient industrial policy creates jobs and provides economic growth. Unfortunately, there is still no common analytical formula used for calculating emissions, and the amount of emissions caused by air transport is not included.

Energy efficiency was also a topic of discussion in Durban. In this context, this paved the way for new opportunities and chances. This allows us also to give similar feedback on energy efficiency.

The Committees on Industry, Research and Energy and on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety must produce, along with the Commission and by the time of COP 18, specific proposals for reducing emissions.</literal>

Of course, as has been said here, not until we have a global agreement will we be satisfied. That is something that we, as the European Union, will certainly have to strive for, as we encourage others to join us.

I wish to raise a single matter, which is one of concern. This new climate agreement now excludes the possibility of compensation for emissions from deforestation, and this is a very worrying development, especially for European countries dominated by forest. Previously, of course, it was possible for the carbon sink, which is truly massive in these forested countries, to compensate for emissions. An example is to be found in my own country, Finland, where 85% of the land surface is forest, which is well looked after. The tree growth is 10 million cubic metres a year greater than the loss. This is a real slap in the face for these countries, and I hope that we can somehow bring about changes to this situation.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had the opportunity to participate in the conference at Durban, and I realised how pointless it was.

We spent around EUR 300 000 on an event that produced nothing but hot air. The European Union and European Parliament had their offices in the garage of the Hilton hotel. When our delegation met the Chinese delegation we were treated like morons. We were given a talk of about twenty minutes by one of their deputy ministers and then their delegation upped and left, without even listening to what our President Jo Leinen had to say, leaving us standing there in shock.

We need to be careful about being top of the class. At a time of serious economic crisis, we risk putting too much pressure on the budgets of our enterprises. It would be much better to have the courage to tax goods imported from the countries that pollute the most and to use the income to fight climate change. I say a categorical ‘no’ to a Green Fund paid for by our citizens, most of which would end up in the pockets of the Chinese.</literal>

  –Mr President, the longest climate conference ever held has ultimately only produced one thing: hot air. The EU and the other Kyoto states have committed to new climate targets for 2013, but these countries are only responsible for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the main polluters – China and the US – have not signed the Kyoto Protocol and were not prepared to agree in Durban on common goals for 2013.

Therefore, we need to consider carefully what we can do ourselves, for example, subsidies for public transport and agriculture. While imported kiwi fruit are so cheap that native fruit is allowed to fall to the ground and rot and while animals are transported all across Europe, we will still be saddling ourselves with unnecessary environmental problems. We must focus on our regional economic cycles and we must not shut down our industry because it is no longer competitive internationally when other global players are failing to follow the ground rules or even to accept them in the first place.</literal>

               Mr President, I fully share Ms Manner’s concern regarding the way in which carbon sinks are calculated. I am not going to speak any more about that, however. Instead, I wish to say that I am surprised that we here in Europe think as if the strategy according to the Kyoto model, with its emission ceilings, is the only way to save the climate. Considering the results, at least, it is not, so I wonder why we still adhere to it. If we look at the statistics, it is evident that the United States, for example, has cut its emissions in the last ten years or so more effectively than the EU, which is committed to Kyoto. The USA and the big emitters have rejected this model, as have Japan, Russia, Australia and, most recently, Canada, which said that it was remaining outside the Kyoto agreement because it was ineffective. Mr Kent, that country’s Minister of the Environment, said that if Kyoto was anything, it was a barrier, a barrier to an effective climate policy.

We did not save anything of significance at Durban. We saved a model that we desperately cling to. However, the model has no support globally. Just nine countries have adopted the same tactics as the EU in reducing emissions. Kyoto accounts for 15% of global emissions. Should this not inspire this House to demand real results? Now that we are looking for a common new agreement for everyone, the EU must abandon its obsessions. We therefore need something more comprehensive, more satisfactory to take its place. Only that could be called an effective policy.</literal>

Personally I believe, and I always underline that we must not forget about the current economic situation caused by the global economic crisis, where many markets, and not only European ones but also global markets are wondering what will happen in the near future. All these questions are affected by globalisation, the financial crisis and the interests of individual countries, so I think that the position of the European Union should be a compromise and take into account the current economic situation in the world and in Europe, the position of both people and entrepreneurs who create jobs together with the views of the world’s largest economies, such as India, China and the USA.</literal>

               –At the conference in Durban the European Union made another attempt to implement the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol commitments. During the conference, Poland was labelled ‘fossil of the day’ for its constant unwillingness to reduce greenhouse gases. Those who sought to find ways of reducing emissions and implement these were deemed completely unreasonable.

EU commitments should be conditional on comparable commitments from other world economies in order to safeguard the competitiveness of the EU economy. In addition, the largest developing countries should be adequately involved in the process, according to the conclusions of the European Council of October 2009. At present, Europe emits only 11% of the total COemissions into the atmosphere and fully meets its commitment to reduce emissions, as stipulated in the protocol. Only concerted action can help fight climate change. The European Union should not agree to extend the Kyoto Protocol without the participation of these key countries. This scenario would result in a transitional agreement relating to only a fraction of emissions. Therefore, the EU’s ability to provide effective global leadership in the fight against climate change will largely depend on its ability to attract large emitters to join the fight against climate change in a legally binding manner. Solidarity and fair and equitable distribution of reduction commitments should be the pillars of the further development of climate policy in the EU.</literal>

               At the end of November and beginning of December last year, a conference on climate change was held in Durban, South Africa. The need to keep the global average temperature increase below two degrees Celsius was one of the key themes of this international forum. As I stated last year, this goal is also one of the main priorities of the European Union on environmental issues. However, it is quite difficult to evaluate the results of this conference. On the one hand, the Durban conference paved the way for a common legally binding agreement on reducing the increases in emissions and greenhouse gases and keeping the global average temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius, or a two-stage threshold. It is still only path to a binding agreement. What is most important, however, is that it was possible to find a consensus among the biggest producers of emissions and greenhouse gases, including the United States, because only through a common approach will a starting point be found on the issue of climate change.</literal>

Although we cannot say that Durban was a huge success, we can still applaud the fact that through intense negotiations, delegations from the 190 largest economies have committed to the long haul. The greatest success, without a doubt, was managing to keep the two most reluctant parties at the negotiating table: the United States and India. The United States have always been sceptical about climate change, and India, meanwhile, is among the emerging powers that refuse to acknowledge their part in the current climate situation and that believe that this is the responsibility of the long-standing industrialised countries.

               –At the Cancún Climate Conference, it was brought up as a solution that in exchange for contributing to the European Union’s 30% emission reduction commitment Central and Eastern European Member States should be allowed to a limited extent to carry over their unused emission allowances. This solution seems favourable in several respects. Firstly, even during an economic crisis the whole of the European Union should strive to be at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Through appropriate regulatory means, European companies could be encouraged to undertake innovations in energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and water and resource efficiency. In future such technologies in the service of energy and resource efficiency will represent the foundations of European competitiveness. Without innovation there can be no competitiveness, without a competitive economy there can be no employment, without jobs the European social model cannot be sustainable. Secondly, such an agreement could also be to the advantage of the Central and Eastern European Member States. The reason for this is that by selling their climate assets they can make up for missing funds necessary to implement a shift to an economic model based on sustainability. In Hungary’s case the estimated value of these climate assets is around EUR 900–1 000 million; revenues of this amount could be an immense help in achieving a green economic turning point in Hungary. I therefore encourage Member State representatives in the Council to agree on the carryover of Central and Eastern European emission allowances during the term of the Danish Presidency, which has a positive attitude towards this initiative.</literal>

               . –Mr President, I would like to start at the very heart of the matter by explaining what exactly we are talking about when we mention waste electrical and electronic equipment, because many people will say: all this stuff about waste electrical and electronic equipment really does not matter very much. One million mobile phones contain 250 kg of silver, 24 kg of gold, 9 kg of palladium and 9 tonnes of copper. One tonne of mobile phones contains 50 times more gold than one tonne of the earth from which gold is extracted. This illustrates just how valuable raw materials are and it can be shocking to learn just how casually materials are illegally shipped from Europe. Waste is exported to Africa, India and China, where it is recycled under ruinous environmental standards; while we can achieve 90% quality with our recycling and reuse, other countries compare quite badly with only around 18 or 19%.

The significance is clear. For this reason, I am actually quite happy that we have taken the right approach with some of the fundamental questions in this directive: illegal shipments of waste are becoming rarer because we have introduced the reversal of the burden of proof. Yet, we are once again faced with the question of whether Member States, including my own country, are really prepared and able to provide personnel to enforce these regulations at the customs posts in our ports.

Which brings us to another important point, namely collection targets. These collection targets have been significantly increased. Sweden manages to collect 16 kg while one wonderful country to the south with a city with which I share my name collects a paltry three kilos. On the one hand, we have a marvellous achievement and, on the other, a disaster. The collection quotas in many of the founding Member States of the Union are 3 and 4 kg per person. This will be seen by our children as a sign of our inadequacies, because we are selling off our raw materials or sending them to the waste tip, where no one will ever be able to reach them.

Luckily, we have reached these collection targets. Unfortunately, we have had to deal with an extremely phlegmatic institution of the European Union in the Council, which has shown itself to be not particularly friendly towards Europe throughout the negotiations. Let me give you an example: if a business in Europe produces a light bulb today, then sometime in the future it is going to have to bring it for recycling. It then has to register 27 times in 27 different countries so that the recycling issue can be clarified.

This is national politics at its worst. It is astonishing that a single registration suffices when it comes to the different VAT regimes, but not recycling. This is a tragedy for the Council. It is unfortunate that the Council has had its way here and that the small and medium-sized enterprises that produce light bulbs will have to register them separately in each of the 27 Member States of the Union in future. This alone will cost EUR 60 million per year for each individual process. I consider this to be disastrous.

Although some red tape has been done away with, the Council naturally sees the money that businesses have to pay as an attractive source of income. Unfortunately, it is the Council and the Member States that have control of this money, leading to major toing and froing when a light bulb is first sold in France and then supplied to Italy through a dealer. An enormous amount of money moves around, something that could be managed much more easily through the use of modern technology.

Mr Potočnik, I am personally very grateful to you and your staff for having played such a decisive role in the process. If it were not for you, these negotiations would have failed.

The Council has behaved in a way I have not seen before in my 22 years of experience. I include my own country in this. The determination to link European environmental policy with economic criteria has declined to sorry proportions. Miserable national policies are being pursued, while we have not even managed to come up with a Europe-wide definition of the term ‘recycling’. The Member States can all do what they want.

We have started along the right path. Nonetheless, we have a lot of work to do in getting the Council to move in the right direction. To reiterate, my criticisms are directed at everyone, not just one individual. Thank you very much for your patience.</literal>

               . –Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to Karl-Heinz Florenz and the Commission for the work they have done. As we know, this is a new version of the directive that came into force on 13 February 2003, in other words almost 10 years ago. Unfortunately we have actually achieved very little to date if we look at the EU averages.

Mr Florenz mentioned a few figures from various Member States and, as has been said, the differences are extreme. Let me quote some examples: Romania has collected 0.8 kg and Liechtenstein, which is not a Member State but which is not performing particularly well, 1.4 kg – while Germany has collected 7.8 kg, the Czech Republic 4.3 kg and the countries of Northern Europe have achieved great successes. We need to be clear about one thing: if we are not capable of establishing a recycling system in our economy, then we will come unstuck in the long term, because the earth only has a finite supply of raw materials.

For this reason I believe that the statement the Commissioner has now made represents a decisive point because it indicates that ecological design must also include reuse, in other words the time after the product has been used, in the design phase.

The old directive contained a number of weaknesses. These included the fact that there was no link to the Eco-design Directive. Of course, the rigid collection target of 4 kg is not appropriate to economic development in the various Member States, either. The current approach as set down in the new proposal makes far more sense, involving targets of 65% of the goods brought into circulation and 85% of the WEEE produced after the transitional phase.

The abilities of the Member States to develop efficient collecting systems will also be of decisive importance, however. A lot will also depend on the dexterity of the Member States in lending a helping hand to consumers. Here too, the role of the consumers is vitally important in taking matters into their own hands. Door-to-door collections are not the answer.

On the whole, it will be a matter for the Member States to decide how to implement this system. I have faith in the Commission to monitor performance closely, so that these collection targets are met. In the long term, this is our only chance to provide these vital resources for industry and to maintain the environment in the state we need.</literal>

               Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, William Painter was the inventor of the crown cap and, at the end of the nineteenth century, he told his friend and colleague, King Camp Gillette – I assume he is the one who manufactured those razor blades – something to this effect: ‘If you really want to get rich, then you have to make products that people throw away’. I believe that the two gentlemen failed to realise at that moment that this was the beginning of what we now know as the throwaway society, for a long time a symbol of our progress, but today, in reality, a huge, huge problem.

When the directive came out for the first time in 2003, we turned our attention – rightly, because these things are still very important – to the problems that that throwaway society poses to our environment, air quality and soil quality and the social consequences of the poor dismantling and recycling of such electronic waste in developing countries. Allow me to reiterate that these remain very important arguments. However, as the Commissioner said, there is, of course, one further, additional issue, in particular the issue of the noble metals, those important raw materials used in our mobile phones and other electronic products.

As a result, during this recast, we have received enormous support from a particular segment of the industry. Support, ladies and gentlemen – and the rapporteur has already referred to this – that we have also received from the Commission, but unfortunately not from the Council, which, for one reason or another, is still in the frame of mind where it thinks that rules are not a good thing. Well, in this case, the rules are not only good, but they are also very much necessary, if we are to achieve our targets. Ambitious recycling targets, extremely robust rules for export and making sure that small products, in particular – for instance, our mobile phones, where we keep a lot of important information – comply with the more ambitious targets.

Finally, I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur – and I do so with a great deal of conviction – because it is under her able leadership and thanks to her experience that we have nevertheless been able to push through Parliament’s strong position as far as possible. However, as I said just now, the Council actually seems to be on totally the wrong wavelength. That is also the reason why I, together with my group, will definitely and with great conviction vote for this result tomorrow.</literal>

I would like, at this point, to express my gratitude to Commissioner Potočnik for his excellent assistance and cooperation, as well as to the rapporteur Karl-Heinz Florenz, who demonstrated strong leadership and contributed to Parliament’s general strong stance and the final positive outcome. The new, better directive means that we can set the terms for more efficient, better quality recycling of electronic and electrical waste.

As you are aware, until now only 30% of this waste has been processed in accordance with the directive’s standards. The remaining 70% either ended up in rubbish dumps or was illegally exported outside the European Union, which means a significant loss of valuable raw materials for all of us. The new directive will create conditions for establishing a new common European market for collecting and processing electronic and electrical waste.

An open scope is envisaged for the directive, which means that six years after it comes into force, in 2018, all electronic and electrical waste will come under the scope of this directive. A new, more ambitious waste collection target will come into force after 2019, when we will collect 65% of all electronic and electrical waste from devices placed on the market.

Another new feature which will greatly help increase the volumes recycled and favour a more efficient raw materials policy is the obligation on sales outlets with an area of more than 400 square metres to accept small electrical appliances and electronic devices from consumers. Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely believe in the attributes of the new directive. I think that this is a great joint success for us and I believe that this is a success for all Europeans and their future benefit.</literal>

As the Group of the Greens, we pushed, in particular, for collection targets to be increased and calculated on the basis of the waste produced, for distributors to be forced to collect waste electrical and electronic equipment without any obligation to buy it from the consumer and for stricter controls of such waste to be introduced in terms of reuse and exportation to non-OECD countries.

We did not manage to squeeze a commitment out of manufacturers to state that waste electrical and electronic equipment contains nanomaterials, but we did manage to persuade the Commission to evaluate if selective treatment of nanomaterials in such waste is necessary.

I trust that Parliament will cast a positive vote and, of course, will deal with low collection rates, improvements to management and treatment and controls of illegal exports of waste electrical and electronic equipment to third countries.</literal>

               Mr President, may I say how nice it is to see you back in the Chair again this week.

In my view, this recast was proposed by the Commission as a consequence of failure – the failure by Member States to put in place effective recycling systems for electrical equipment in the 2003-2008 period – because in 2008 over 70% of waste electronics was still being landfilled, incinerated or illegally exported. That simply was not good enough. We all agreed on that. It was interesting to hear how much the Greens have apparently put into this, but I would like to lay its success clearly at the door of Karl-Heinz Florenz, the rapporteur, who worked so hard on getting a good solution.

So now we have some changes. They are mostly welcome, but we do need to make sure that they will contribute to improving the situation. Collection targets have been considerably adjusted, both in their methodology and their ambition. Some Member States have been given more time. I approve of that because, if we want to work with them, they need to build effective systems.

I am happy that Member States have retained significant control over many aspects – particularly financial – and especially welcome the fact that we have avoided any attempts at compulsory increases in costs for municipalities. But with this flexibility comes responsibility for Member States. I believe that consumers want to be able to recycle and reuse effectively, particularly in this challenging economic environment, so they must have the information and the opportunity to do so. Member States now have a flexible framework that we have worked very hard to deliver. The ball is now in their court to deliver their side.</literal>

               . –Mr President, the Member States and the industrialised nations have been living beyond their means for many years. It is nothing new when I tell you that we can only enjoy a lifestyle like this at the expense of the poorer countries of the world. The WEEE Directive addresses at least part of the problem. The open area of application is of decisive importance. This approach can and should set an example in terms of environmental legislation.

I am pleased that a collection target of 85% has been set, particularly because the Council held out stubbornly for lower targets for a long time. I constantly find myself saying: Parliament needs to flex its muscles. After all, people will only invest in environmentally-friendly technologies and innovation will only be encouraged if legislators speed up their work.

With this in mind, I also welcome the fact that solar modules are not to be excluded from the directive. It was right not to rely on a voluntary, self-imposed commitment by the manufacturers. All too often in the past, Parliament has bowed to pressure and given in to such deals. These deals have also often proven to be just another way for the industry to drag its heels.

Nonetheless, I do not agree with the way the directive deals with nanomaterials. It is essential that waste equipment containing nanomaterials should be dealt with separately. The report simply invites the Commission to investigate whether this is to continue to happen in the future, however. This is an extraordinarily weak formulation that is not worth a great deal. Nanomaterials can be hazardous for people and the environment during the recycling process. Some nanomaterials come with clear indicators stating that they are damaging to health. I am therefore calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation. If it is not possible to prove conclusively that these products are not hazardous, then they should not be allowed onto the market.

Overall, however, I am satisfied with the results in this context. The perseverance of Parliament in its negotiations with the Council has paid off. I should also like to thank the rapporteur for this.</literal>

               –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive requires Member States to carry out separate collection of electrical and electronic equipment waste and sets collection and recycling targets.

The agreement reached with the Council focuses on reducing the administration costs to manufacturers of the registration and reporting procedures. It has raised the recycling target by 5% and set the collection rate at 65% by the end of 2016, with mandatory collection of small equipment by retailers, luckily only for outlets with a surface area of more than 400 square metres.

I am in favour of the text, which is the result of a compromise that takes national requirements into account and safeguards small manufacturers, as at an earlier stage of the discussions mandatory collection also applied to smaller shops. It is crucial for the success of the new collection system that Member States no longer allow unauthorised collectors to receive domestic appliances that no longer work, as these would no longer be part of official recycling calculations.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are undoubtedly talking about a highly sensitive and important issue.

As Mr Florenz pointed out, when we talk about waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), we are talking about dangerous pollutants that endanger both the environment and human health, and we are also talking about an extraordinary opportunity for recycling raw materials which, as we know, Europe desperately needs. These are precious metals and rare earths, such as indium, which costs thousands of euros a kilo.

However, I wanted to respond to what Mr Florenz said, because he made a reference to my country. While it is true that it is not at the levels of northern Europe where WEEE recycling is already well-established, it is also true that it has made extraordinary progress in the last few years and that there are vast differences within the country, because in northern Italy we have very high collection levels.

In my region, the Veneto, for example, which is in third place, we already have a substantial collection that exceeds 5-5.41 kilos, and peaks of excellence such as Belluno, with 7.36 kilos, while Emilia Romagna, for example, serves 100% of its citizens and therefore has total coverage. This trend is very positive, rising 27% in the last year.

Therefore I believe we must consider what has been done thus far as an achievement and appreciate that we are on the right track. We need to launch a large-scale information campaign for citizens. Essentially we need to reinforce all the existing structures, and maybe also to update the figures as these might not have kept up with the rapid pace of improvement.</literal>

  –Mr President, waste electrical and electronic equipment is a source of household waste which is seeing one of the fastest growth rates, while also being one of the most dangerous. The majority of this waste is not managed properly and ends up in landfills, thereby discharging toxic chemicals into the environment.

I therefore welcome the proposal from the Commission for improving and increasing collection. However, as in other areas, the situation on the ground differs hugely from one Member State to another, which must be taken into consideration so that the legislation is effective and easy to apply.

In Romania the electrical goods market is not yet saturated. In other words, we are not throwing away yet as many electrical and electronic goods as other Member States. It would therefore be important for us to have more time available to adapt to the ambitious targets set by the new regulations. The gradual rise in collection rates in the next seven years, which has been established as part of this package, partially provides us with the flexibility we need.

In overall conclusion, the compromise that has been reached strikes a balance between the ambitious nature of the targets set and a realistic deadline allowing them to be achieved. I wish to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for the work they did and the results they achieved during what were extremely tough negotiations with the Council.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Karl-Heinz Florenz on his success. This was a truly Herculean task. He and the committee have worked on this topic for over three years.

I do not wish to repeat what many of my fellow Members have said, but instead would emphasise one small aspect that is very important for the public. I am talking about energy-saving bulbs. Energy-saving bulbs make sense and use 80% less electricity than conventional incandescent bulbs. However, they contain rare earths that need to be recovered, as well as a small amount of mercury. They contain 200 times less mercury than the thermometers that were still in common use up to a few years ago. This mercury needs to be disposed of correctly, however.

We have given citizens little guidance in this area in recent times. I experienced this myself in the town where I come from: I wanted to dispose of some small items of electrical equipment, but I was told: you need to take that to the recycling centre outside town. It is open every Tuesday until 15.30. Is there anyone in regular employment who would have time before 15.30 on a Tuesday? The service must be made more user-friendly. That is why I have drawn up an amendment with some of my colleagues, requiring that energy-saving bulbs and other small items of electrical equipment should be returned to the shop. Alternatively, a different, user-friendly solution must be found. I am grateful to Mr Florenz and the shadow rapporteurs for having pushed this amendment through. This is a signal to the public that we take their problems seriously, that we include them in our deliberations, and that we want to make it easy for them to return such equipment, so that it can be disposed of correctly.</literal>

               Mr President, may I, first of all, pay my compliments to the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job. His task was certainly not an easy one. The fact is that we literally have gold lying in the streets. We are actually throwing precious metals away, even though we can really no longer afford to do this, at this time of crisis.

Modern products – as we have already heard: not only mobile phones, but also printed circuit boards and, actually, all modern electrical and electronic equipment – are packed with all kinds of stuff that we want to get back. This is what we have addressed in the directive. It deals mainly with collection, but it should not just be about collection, because if a butcher takes apart a mobile phone, he will not be as skilled at it as a specialist.

Therefore, this is ultimately not just about collecting electrical and electronic equipment. We also have to ask ourselves if we really want to recover the materials that we are interested in from that particular piece of equipment. For that reason, when you talk about collection, you also have to look at reuse, dismantling, pre-processing, recycling and remelting. In addition, we need to look at recovering as much as we can and recovering the best quality resources, instead of just recovering what is easiest to recover. Because we all know that this equipment will very soon be dumped across the border, and that will be harmful to the environment and we will not even have managed to recover the materials that we want from it.</literal>

Unfortunately we have different opinions on this subject, but most of us strive to achieve the same goal: to reduce the quantity of waste electric and electronic equipment. At the moment this document is of crucial importance, because we are talking about wanting to save resources, whilst using waste, namely waste from electric and electronic equipment.

We have difficulties, in Europe, in finding raw materials to produce electronic equipment. Here is a hint: we can actually move forward because those raw materials are in our waste. We must not disregard this waste. The volume of waste should be reduced by recycling. It is also very important to extend the life of equipment. Currently we use equipment for a very short period and often novelty causes us to replace it quickly.

We should also replicate the best practices in operation in Europe, identifying the relevant country and model. One last thing - penalties are a last resort in law enforcement. Let us first show that there are good models and implement them.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for far too long Europeans have generated waste with no or little concern about end-of-life recycling. Even now too few citizens instinctively deal with their waste electrical and electronic equipment. For example, last weekend, when I wanted to return a power strip to my local DIY store, the salesman did not have a clue what he was supposed to do with it. Fortunately, his supervisor told him that, in his shop, there was actually a collection point available to customers, which he only found out about at the same time as me. There is still a long way to go in this area.

As we have already said, currently only 33% of waste electrical and electronic equipment is collected and treated appropriately.

I will therefore be voting in favour of the text negotiated fiercely by Karl-Heinz Florenz, and I congratulate him for the outstanding work he has done throughout recent months. I congratulate him because he has set each Member State a target collection rate, by 2016, of 85% of waste electrical and electronic generated by their country. Above all, he gives them the resources to achieve this through increasing the number of collection points for this type of waste and reaffirming the principle of free waste disposal.

This directive will allow progress to be made in terms of collection. It will support and reinforce a gradual change of behaviour in European citizens.

Get sorting citizens of Europe! It does not cost anything, it is good for the planet and good for future generations.

I take this opportunity, Mr President, to congratulate you on your election and ask you to make your contribution to energy efficiency by trying to raise the temperature in here but use less air conditioning. It is cold in this Chamber and, for the sake of energy efficiency, it would be better to alter the temperature settings.</literal>

Improperly treated or even untreated waste from electrical and electronic equipment is a significant threat for the environment and the health of people living in the European Union. The rapidly increasing volumes of this type of waste require a speedy response in the form of the adoption of modern and responsible legislation that will encourage more separate collection and recycling. I firmly believe that it is essential that the EU and Member States give clear guidance to companies so that they manage resources better, including by recovering discarded but still usable equipment or their component parts. Sustainable production is closely related to the development of innovations and intelligent recovery of the resources already available.</literal>

  –Madam President, waste electrical and electronic equipment is the form of waste with the fastest growth potential in the EU, estimated to reach 12.3 million tonnes by 2020.

I welcome the reform of the Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment and emphasise the need for investment in recycling raw materials and rare earths since the mining, refining and recycling of rare earths have serious consequences for the environment if they are not managed properly.

Failure to comply with the appropriate procedures when treating waste electrical and electronic equipment causes damage to the environment, especially through the discharge of heavy metals such as mercury from compact fluorescent lamps and flat screens, and lead from television sets.

According to the Commission, only 33% of waste electrical and electronic equipment is officially collected separately, with the possibility of a large amount of this material, which has been collected and not declared, being treated in the EU without suitable environmental protection, or sent illegally to developing countries where certain valuable materials are recycled in a manner that is hazardous to health and the environment, or else dumped.</literal>

Too much of our waste is ending up polluting the lives of Africans. This is a very toxic waste stream pouring out of Europe. It is immoral on two fronts, financial and environmental: financial because much of the minerals and chemicals we export have been imported into Europe and we have paid good money for them – we are wasting what could and should be used again – but also environmental because these countries cannot deal with our waste. Through the burning and physical handling of this toxic waste, vast natural areas, as well as men, women and children, are polluted and chemically burned.

These renewed proposals are much overdue – and I thank the rapporteur – but they will be worthless unless we enforce their provisions in every Member State and stop the exports now. We owe this to ourselves and to our currently abused neighbours.</literal>

I believe the introduction in large retail stores of free collection points for used equipment is a great success, as has already been mentioned. This is without a doubt one of the strong points of the new regulation. It is axiomatic and good that this principle has finally been settled. I think the compromise negotiated by Parliament and the Polish Presidency is balanced. The changes will contribute to raising the level of environmental protection and human health.

               Madam President, it is the beginning of January and the season has just started. The season when companies publish their annual figures for the year just past and their expectations for the coming year. We all know that these will be poor. They will be disappointing. Of course, we have the economic crisis, high unemployment and disappointing sales to blame for this.

However, I will tell you a secret. The explosive increase in the cost of raw materials will be reflected in almost all of these corporate figures. These materials have gone up in price by dozens of percentage points in recent years. That will have a lasting impact on the European economy. That is also the essence of the directive that we are discussing today. Because we are throwing away hundreds of kilos of gold, silver, platinum and cobalt without reusing them. The Council ought to give this issue top priority. Unfortunately, the Council seems to be penny-wise and pound-foolish. This is very similar to the way in which it has been tackling the euro crisis.

Madam President, I would, nonetheless, like to thank the Commission, together with Mr Florenz as rapporteur, for having done an excellent job of ensuring a good compromise but, ultimately, the compromise is still not what we need if we are really to have a Europe that deals efficiently with its resources.</literal>

Citizens want to recycle more, but it is far too complicated at present. I think it is good that we are tightening up the rules and making it more difficult to export electronic waste, because, as we have heard here, this is a very bad way to influence development in Africa and other poor countries, which are currently forced to deal with our hazardous waste.

I think that it would have been even better if we could have already had separate targets for small electronic devices that are quite easy to collect. However, there is a risk that this will not be done if we do not have separate targets. I hope that the Commission will present a sound proposal in this regard very soon.</literal>

               –I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the successful negotiations, thanks to which a crucial directive on European resource efficiency has been adopted. We are all aware of the fact that as the quantity of our waste electronic equipment rises year by year Europe is faced by a myriad challenges. Unprofessional collection and treatment not only entail serious health and environmental implications, but in carelessly letting such equipment ‘go to waste’ Europe is also losing valuable raw materials in an increasingly intense global competition for resources. The current recast of the Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment provides a suitable framework for addressing these challenges. Indeed, the compromise reached stipulates for Member States collection targets which are not only ambitious, but also take account of the consumption habits of the various countries. In Eastern Europe, for example, there is a smaller chance of consumers replacing their household appliances within three to four years after their purchase, and will rather continue to use their old devices in their holiday houses. With its four kilograms per capita per year target, the ‘one size fits all’ approach of the previous directive was unable to address such market specificities. One of the most important aspects of the present agreement is therefore that, depending on a Member State’s choice, the amount of products introduced to the market or the amount of waste products actually generated can be used as the basis for the calculation of collection targets in the future. This option makes the achievement of the objectives of the directive realistic and it can thereby make an actual contribution to increasing European resource efficiency.</literal>

WEEE that has not been properly treated poses a significant danger to health and to the environment and can contain hazardous material, such as mercury (in switches), lead (in solder) or cadmium (in batteries). Under the EU’s 2020 strategy, the EU is determined to improve the recycling and reuse rates of WEEE and to tackle the expending of resources. I welcome the directive’s strong measures, especially the provisions that say that it should be easier for consumers to have access to WEEE facilities and that free WEEE recycling facilities should be made available in any sales centre larger than 400 square metres. That would put extra pressure on producers and on small businesses, and therefore, I support the report’s recommendations in relation to simplified reporting responsibilities and measures to prevent the implementation of double-costing of fees for producers, who are responsible for waste management costs.</literal>

Barely one third of electronic and electrical waste is processed according to requirements, with the remainder bound for landfills or illegally exported to third countries.

The new directive marks an important step forward towards a more extensive recovery of this waste, because it sets high targets: 85% of generated electronic waste (or 65% of electronic equipment placed on the market) must be collected through an organised scheme by the end of the decade. Requirements are being introduced for drawing up standards for the collection, processing, recovery, recycling and reuse of such waste, by which means the same hi-tech requirements are to be established in Member States.

One very important aspect is the electronic waste collection schemes, especially the possibility for electronic equipment businesses with an area of more than 400 mto take back small waste electronic equipment, which may actually increase the level of organised collection.

               . –Madam President, I would like to use the whole of my speaking time at the beginning, because I have another important meeting that conflicts with this and we are running rather late. I hope you will allow that.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after more than two years of very intensive debates and negotiations, we are now able to present a fully developed document regarding a regulation concerning the authorisation of biocidal products in the European Union. Following the rules for chemicals in the REACH Regulation and the Regulation on Pesticides, we are for the first time also regulating the authorisation and placing on the market of biocidal products. In the third trialogue with the Polish Presidency on 17 November, we were able to reach an agreement at second reading. Today, we can say that we – the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission – have succeeded in making major improvements in respect of environmental protection and consumer protection, but also in terms of providing for a simple and faster European authorisation procedure. At this point, I would like to thank everyone involved – my fellow Members, colleagues in the Commission and also the Council – most sincerely for their excellent cooperation and for their readiness to compromise and work together.

Biocidal products are essential for a high standard of health and hygiene in our society. Disinfectants and pesticides protect against dangerous diseases and are used to protect highly perishable materials. Biocidal products are, however, also used as preservatives, for example in paints or wood preservatives or as sealants for automobile lacquer or to treat furniture and fabrics. Thus, we come across biocidal products very often in our day-to-day lives. They have an effect and thus also a side-effect that can be dangerous to people. The 1998 Biocidal Products Directive contained no harmonisation of active substance testing and product authorisation between the individual Member States, and lengthy coordination procedures among different national authorities made authorisation almost impossible.

However, we also need regulation in this area on account of the incidents that have occurred in recent years where sofas and boots imported from Asia have resulted in skin irritation and poisonings. In future, only goods that have been treated with biocidal products authorised in the EU may be placed on the market here. Our aim is to find a balance between benefit and risk. We have laid down stringent exclusion criteria for active substances and products. However, we are aware that the risk associated with not using biocidal products also needs to be taken into consideration. Where there is a risk of danger, it must also be possible to have exceptions. These are clearly defined and apply only if an active substance is necessary for reasons of public health or animal health or if not authorising the biocidal product would have negative consequences for society.

Consumers want to be informed. Thus, there will be labelling requirements in respect of the name of the active substance and its biocidal properties, relevant instructions for use and indications of danger and any content of active substances in nanoform.

Our aim is to achieve faster EU-wide authorisation of products and active substances. For Parliament, this can be best achieved by means of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). In order to avoid a back-log of applications or authorisations, we have agreed on the introduction of the Community authorisation system in stages. Products with low-risk active substances are to be authorised EU-wide by the ECHA by means of a simplified procedure. We want a uniform internal market. Therefore, Member States can only refuse an authorisation on their sovereign territory in clearly defined circumstances and with the consent of the Commission.

The authorisation procedure must be efficient and simple. If it is just the colour or the aroma that is to be changed, then we do not need to go through this whole authorisation procedure again. Studies must be made available under controlled conditions in order to avoid the duplication of animal experiments, but also, ultimately, to share the costs. Only if research companies have the opportunity to recoup the high costs of testing active substances and getting products authorised through the marketing of the products will they also be prepared to invest in future. All users must be fully aware of the effects of biocidal products, in particular those who use these products in a professional capacity on behalf of others. If I try and get rid of lice on my head myself, that is at my own risk and I am doing it for myself. However, if I go to a professional hairdresser for this purpose and pay him for it, then I expect him to have had the best possible training and the risk-free use of the products to ultimately be guaranteed. Thus, his training must include information on the use of biocidal products. The same applies to pest controllers, car body painters, painters and joiners.

As Parliament, we will not lose sight of the demand for a directive for the sustainable use of biocidal products – just as we will monitor the implementation of the regulation, which is now the responsibility of the Member States. We are all aware that this sort of regulation is not set in stone. There are sure to be more amendments and additions over time. Even now, some issues remain unresolved. For example, the demand for the delegated acts that give Parliament more rights of scrutiny in accordance with the new Treaty of Lisbon. It is certainly the case that political decisions are often involved in the implementation, too. It is important that Parliament be involved in the decision making when it comes to setting fees and with regard to the authorisation of active substances. In these areas, we have not been granted the involvement that we are entitled to and therefore we will make it clear in a written statement that this does not set a precedent for future legislative acts. Democracy requires the participation of elected representatives, in this case the participation of the European Parliament. I would like once again to offer my sincere thanks to all of those who have contributed to this.</literal>

               . –Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Klaß for the work she has done here. It was certainly a very difficult dossier, and we spent a long time grappling with it before we found a common line, particularly among the different groups.

Biocidal products must, by their very nature, involve active substances that entail a certain amount of danger, otherwise they would not have any effect. Achieving the balance is the big challenge. Our consumers cannot understand why many active substances should be more dangerous in some Member States than in others. Therefore, it is also important from the point of view of the single market that we put this European authorisation system in place here. It is very important that we make progress in this regard and make it clear to consumers that the single market should apply in this important area, too, and what is dangerous and prohibited in Denmark should not be authorised in other Member States like Italy or Portugal, either. We have also clearly defined the substances for which we are prepared to accept exceptions, so that Member States that want to go a step further are actually able to do so. We have surely therefore fulfilled our task of ensuring a high level of environmental and consumer protection while, on the other hand, also recognising the special characteristics of the Member States.

The importance of this matter is also demonstrated by the fact that, these days, we can probably say that there is hardly anything that we handle in our day-to-day lives that is not treated with these substances. There have also been rumours recently that there are problems in various hotels in this wonderful city, where certain small animals are seemingly terrorising the place. Here, too, we see that it is perhaps necessary to do something to combat these animals. I just mention this in passing.

The fact is, we want to create this single market. It is also the case that we are in favour of all products that are placed on our market only being permitted to be treated with substances that have a European authorisation. Thus, no preference is being shown here to imported goods. That is also important for our consumers to know.

We have also tightened up the requirements relating to animal experiments. In this regard, results obtained by other producers must also be incorporated so that as few animals as possible are used.

Overall, this is a perfect compromise. I think all of the groups have worked well together, and Ms Klaß has done a very good job here.</literal>

               –Madam President, every now and then, environmental organisations arrange media events where they present blood that they have tested – either from some of their staff or from well-known people, actors, singers or sometimes even from children. Unfortunately, these tests always show that we are all walking around with chemical residues in our blood. That is not all. It is also possible to find chemical residues in the umbilical cord that connected a child to its mother. Many of these residues come from very harmful chemicals, chemicals that are carcinogenic, endocrine disrupting, toxic to reproduction, bioaccumulating, resistant and toxic, in other words chemicals that are extremely dangerous.

This legislation is intended to help solve this problem. It will ensure that we will get some of the most dangerous chemicals on the market replaced now. What is more, these chemicals are in some products that we all surround ourselves with every day. After all, biocides are actually a good thing. There are biocides in detergents, that is quite sensible. Biocides are used to impregnate textiles and furniture and so on – and that is also quite sensible. However, it is clear that if we have biocides and chemicals in general so close to us in our everyday lives, it is important that they do not contain substances that are extremely dangerous. It is therefore good that we have now adopted legislation that will ensure that we will phase out the most dangerous of these substances.

There are also a couple of other really good elements in this legislation. We are strengthening the rules regarding the labelling requirements for the products. We deal with nanomaterials in biocides in a different and more detailed way. We have set out a plan for how, in the future – once the Commission has submitted a proposal for it – we are to have legislation regulating the use of biocides. We have at last introduced the possibility of allowing a country – despite the fact that we have a common approval procedure – to be granted exemption and prohibit a pesticide where it may be hazardous on grounds of climatic or special national conditions when it might not be so in other countries. I would therefore like to thank the Commission, the Council and my fellow Members, particularly the rapporteur, Ms Klaß.</literal>

               . –Madam President, I would like to apologise on behalf of Corinne Lepage, our shadow rapporteur, who is unable to attend this evening because of the presidential campaign. On her behalf, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Klaß, who has had to leave for a few moments and who held her own in the Council during the second reading on biocides, and, of course, the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent collaboration. Commissioner, Ms Lepage also wishes to thank the Commission for adopting such a constructive attitude and making every effort to promote the compromise that is on the table this evening.

I believe that we have succeeded in establishing a viable system that provides better protection for the environment and the health of users, and it was by no means a foregone conclusion. In particular, we have ensured that the new central authorisation system does not result in a gradual blackout of the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki. The approach adopted – which is a three-stage approach – is the right one and it is also right that for September 2013 priority should be given to low-risk biocidal products and products used primarily for human hygiene and veterinary hygiene purposes.

As I said, the compromise thus improves the system on several fronts: clear criteria for excluding from the market products containing the most harmful substances, the establishment of provisional criteria for endocrine disrupters, better monitoring of nanomaterials, compulsory labelling of treated products and new rights for us as consumers, including the right to request information about these products from the manufacturers. That was one of Parliament’s priorities, aimed at preventing further scandals, such as the sofa scandal, which you might remember, whereby a large French company imported from China sofas containing unauthorised substances, which resulted in serious burns.

I do have one regret, however: the price Parliament has to pay for these improvements is giving up its right of veto concerning the amendment of the list of authorised active substances, and that is a great pity.

Nevertheless, on the whole, the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is obviously pleased that, with this regulation, with REACH and even with the Regulation on pesticides, Europe is today equipping itself with the world’s most ambitious legislation on chemical products, nothing more and nothing less.</literal>

               . –Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Klaß, and the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Polish Presidency on their constructive work.

From now on, consumers will be guaranteed better information. Ms Ries spoke about the sofas imported from Asian countries that contained fungicides and we all know the consequences these had for consumers, including extensive skin problems and severe erythema. Consumers should absolutely have been informed that items had been treated, but that was not the case until now.

For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is essential to reinforce the substitution of highly dangerous active substances by strengthening the exclusion criteria but also by limiting the derogations and introducing national guarantees for the adjustment of the conditions of use of product authorisations. We welcome, too, Commissioner, the specific and detailed provisions on nanomaterials, which you mentioned.

This is a very important matter because we will be informed, there will be labelling, and substances such as nano-silver will have to be specifically authorised and assessed separately, which is justification for the validity of the methods used for the supporting assessment.

The only damper on things – as has been mentioned – is that Parliament has lost its right of veto regarding the approval of active substances. It would seem that that was the price we had to pay for these improvements.</literal>

               Madam President, this proposal on biocides is not perfect but it does present to us a perfect example of a European compromise.

The draft regulation emphasises the introduction of EU-wide authorisation procedures which should operate alongside national approval structures for biocidal products with similar conditions of use, which I welcome. I also welcome the introduction of the concept of low-risk products with a simplified procedure.

This is all moving in the right direction but there are still some areas of concern. I wonder particularly whether we have got the issue of confidentiality right. Transparency is, of course, essential for consumer safety but innovation could be stifled by disproportionate disclosure demands. It is important to be consistent, and I wonder whether the Commission is prepared to consider how this stacks up against the confidentiality and transparency issues in the REACH regulations.

Of course, the composition of products is only one issue. It is also important to think about how they are used. The proposal requires the Commission to come forward in three years’ time with a report on how this regulation contributes to sustainable use, particularly for professional users, and I welcome this initiative from Parliament.

Balancing environmental and consumer protection and promoting the single market are always a regulatory challenge, but I think this proposal has moved us some way forward.</literal>

  –Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation concerning the handling of biocidal products that is to be decided upon tomorrow is extremely important. We encounter biocidal products not only in disinfectants or pesticides; they are also in furniture, lacquers and products that we handle every day. They provide us with a very high level of protection in relation to hygiene.

It is therefore important for us to examine this proposal. From the result, we can see that the highly toxic biocidal products will disappear from the market with this legislation. We have established that the loopholes in the commercial chain will be closed by means of a clear labelling system. I consider this to be extremely important. Consumers will then know what they are buying. However, it also demonstrates a high level of understanding in this area that, in addition to national defence, we are also able to allow exceptions in the area of animal disease control. After all, in this area the threat to animals and people from animal epidemics or other diseases is very high. It is therefore right and important for us to allow exceptions here. This decision is justified by its proportionality.

However, I do not believe it is important for us in Europe to decide how these agents are used. That is something that is subject to the principle of subsidiarity and should be decided by the authorities in the individual Member States. Climate change, transport and many other external influences can deter the use of particular agents or prevent comprehensive implementation. That is why we are leaving that up to the local authorities. We will then surely succeed with regard to biocidal products and the protection of people against toxic substances.</literal>

  –Madam President, I would like to thank my fellow Members in Parliament who have contributed to our success in tightening up several aspects of the Commission’s proposal. I think it is extremely important that we have managed to expand the criteria for which substances are to be subject to the cut-off.

The clearer labelling that will now be introduced is also extremely important and this will hopefully deter consumers and thereby reduce the use of several questionable biocidal products. What is the benefit of triclosan in children’s underwear for example? What informed consumer would buy that for his or her children? However, these things currently appear to be a better choice because they are labelled as being ‘antibacterial’, and there are clearly some parents who believe that it is better to buy such things despite the fact that they pose a risk, even to their own children.

It worries me that this type of substance, which will possibly not fall within the cut-off criteria, is being used to an ever increasing extent, and therefore I look forward to the Commission presenting a new proposal for a directive on the sustainable use of biocidal products which will also tighten the rules for those substances that are not as dangerous as the very worst ones.</literal>

               Madam President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Christa Klaß, for a fine piece of work. This report introduces new rules for placing biocidal products on the European market and brings a number of advantages, most of which have already been mentioned here. These include mainly the right of consumers to information and a ban on the use of extremely hazardous materials, such as carcinogens, as well as the mandatory communication of data Europe-wide, which should prevent the duplication and multiplication of tests on animals, while simplifying data protection and harmonising the fees in individual Member States.

The regulation strengthens the position of the European Chemicals Agency, but at Member State level there are demands for retention of the power to withdraw permission to place a product on a Member State market on public health grounds. The ‘submission fees’ paid to the European Chemicals Agency for submitting a request at national level have also become a legitimate target of criticism. Despite this justified reservation, we are ready to support the regulation.</literal>

I had the opportunity of working on an opinion for it as part of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) in 2010 in conjunction with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI).

For this I would like to thank Ms Klaß for her excellent and I imagine tiring work.

We can confidently state that when this regulation comes into force it will ensure that internal procedures in the European single market are smoother, thanks to simpler authorisation procedures reinforced at EU level, as well as greater monitoring of human and environmental health, as many here have acknowledged. The criteria for removing products that harm living organisms from the market have been reinforced, and at the same time there are exclusion clauses for certain products which have to be used but only when strictly necessary in safe and controlled conditions. Therefore I am pleased with the result and would like to offer my thanks.</literal>

However, I would have preferred a European authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for new biocidal products immediately, and not in stages. That said, the centralised authorisation system will definitely have positive repercussions on the internal market, because it will allow equal application of the requisites in all the Member States. In order to streamline bureaucratic procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises and facilitate the entry of biocides onto the market, we needed to remove comparative assessment, still required for biocides that have been proven to be safe for use. This places a hefty bureaucratic burden on companies.</literal>

  Madam President, new legislation to replace the Biocidal Products Directive is absolutely necessary. I therefore want to congratulate Christa Klaß and all my other colleagues who worked on this dossier, on being able to find common ground with the Council and to reach a compromise agreement.

I am particularly pleased with the provisions for clear labelling, labelling of nanomaterials and the recognition that excessive restrictions on certain products may result in a disproportionately negative impact on society.

However, I would urge the Commission and Member States to be wary of the cost of compliance with the new legislation. We must make sure that the process of getting approval to use necessary products is not so great that the companies who need them cannot afford them. Intimidating costs may mean that many SMEs in my constituency in Scotland, and those in other countries, feel excluded from the entire process.

We must ensure a level playing field and prevent dominant companies from excluding smaller competitors. Just as excessive restrictions on certain products may result in a disproportionate negative impact on society, excessive costs of compliance will have a disproportionate impact on businesses, and particularly on SMEs, which make up a significant part of this sector.</literal>

Special attention must be paid in this case to the protection of children and pregnant women. The main threats to health are substances that have been identified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic or toxic to reproduction and biocumulative, as well as substances with the properties of endocrine disruptors. I therefore agree with the explicit prohibition of the approval of these active substances and EU citizens ought to be confident that none of these hazardous substances are present in the objects of everyday use and especially in drinking water, food or materials and objects intended for contact with food. I also welcome the fact that it is possible to harmonise at a European level, but the costs for small and medium-sized enterprises should not be ruinous.</literal>

For the sake of consistency and clarity, it was necessary to remove a number of inconsistencies contained in the text amending the proposals. The position of the rapporteur, Christa Klaß, who states that to achieve the declared objectives it is necessary to eliminate the shortcomings of Directive 98/8/EC on authorisations and to simplify the entire decision-making process, is legitimate, and should, I think, be collectively supported. The warning of the rapporteur about the duplication of regulations concerning labelling with other legal acts indicates that, in our legislative work, we should monitor more closely the various links and related legal measures. The safety of handling biocidal products, especially in the environment of their professional users, is also a serious related issue, which we will also have to monitor very closely.</literal>

               –The aim of the new European biocide regulations is to exercise tighter control over the impact which they have on health and the environment, while also simplifying the procedure for authorising the products. ‘Biocides’ are products designed to fight harmful organisms and pathogenic germs. They are used to protect human and animal health. They include disinfectants and insecticides and are used for preserving materials, embalming or painting ships to prevent fouling from algae and micro-organisms. The EU has fairly old legislation in this area, which has been in force since 1998. Updating the legislation is a natural step to ensuring that only safe products access the market. The new regulations cover new areas such as furniture and textiles. The most hazardous substances, either carcinogenic or toxic for reproduction, should be banned or used with greater care. The measures also provide a simpler authorisation procedure for placing products on the European market. As far as animal testing is concerned, applicants must share studies on vertebrates in exchange for fair compensation. In the future, an authorisation system needs to be introduced at EU level to establish a harmonised European biocides market.</literal>

The report that I am presenting to you today finalises the work that we have done by analysing the upstream farming sector. Farmers sell their products but they also buy or use numerous inputs, notably fertiliser, seeds and fuel. These inputs are generally sold to them by large multinationals that operate in an extremely concentrated environment that is lacking both transparency and competition. Farmers also need land and water to work.

On the one hand, the bills that farmers have to pay are rocketing while, at the same time, the prices at which they are selling their products are stagnating or even falling in certain cases. They are caught between a rock and a hard place.

The report that I am presenting to you today proposes concrete solutions to improve the economic situation of agricultural holdings and farmers’ incomes. Farmers must be supported through new agricultural development structures that will enable them to cope with future challenges, be they environmental, such as global warming, or economic, such as market booms, caused largely by speculation.

The measures envisaged by the CAP reform, proposed by the Commission and currently under discussion in Parliament, may, if applied effectively by the Member States, improve soil conservation, maintain agricultural biodiversity, and reduce soil and groundwater pollution. This agronomic development will reduce the quantities of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides used. At the same time, farmers will be able to retain a greater share of the added value generated by their work. This will have several consequences. It will help to consolidate farmers’ revenues, contribute to Europe’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the pollution of our water resources.

European agriculture uses more energy than it produces. Without oil, we would be unable to feed ourselves. What a paradox! Between 2000 and 2010, the price of fossil fuels rose by more than 60%, yet farmers are unable to reflect that increase in the prices of their products.

We would like to see considerable investment by the European Union in energy-saving projects. They should be based on several proposals: improving farming practices, by making them more autonomous, reducing transport between producers and consumers, by promoting the establishment of short marketing channels and the consumption of seasonal, local produce, strengthening autonomous energy production on farms, and restoring the balance between animal and plant production for coherent production areas, by encouraging agronomic practices such as crop rotation and grass-fed production.

In addition, the cost of fertiliser doubled in the same 10-year period, while the prices paid to farmers only rose by 25%. There are some efficient agronomic practices, however, notably crop rotation, which significantly reduce usage of these products and, in turn, result in a considerable reduction in both leaching, which pollutes groundwater, and nitrous oxide emissions.

Better crop techniques also lead to a decrease in the use of pesticides and herbicides by reducing the pressure from parasites and weeds. Wastewater and collected water are also a potential source of fertiliser, as long as adequate measures are taken to ensure the effective removal of potentially dangerous substances.

However, the dependence of the European Union and farmers is not limited to oil and phosphates. Every year, we import 50 million tonnes of animal feed. These purchases on the global markets amount to USD 20 billion and this has a serious impact on our trade balance. We need to reduce our dependence by 70% by launching a far-reaching European programme for the production of plant protein: soya, lupins, broad beans, etc.

The 30% average increase in seed prices since 2000 also affects farmers’ incomes. This increase is due to the rising cost of certified seeds, which are sold by an ever-smaller number of large multinationals. However, it is also linked to the measures taken by a number of Member States to restrict the use of farm-saved seeds, which cost 40% less and which are produced and used by the farmers themselves.

Farmers are also affected by the cost of buying land and the cost of leasing land, which have soared in recent years. These phenomena are primarily due to urban sprawl, the monopolising of land for the production of biofuels and the race to expand, linked to the changes in the CAP.

The report calls for the introduction of a system to monitor land prices and appropriate measures to facilitate access to land for young people and those who wish to farm.

Finally, irrigation is essential in many parts of the European Union where the effects of global warming are already being felt. Concrete measures must be put in place as soon as possible to save and preserve this resource.

This report is thus very clearly part of the Europe 2020 strategy drawn up at the start of the parliamentary term and aims to offer a positive perspective for the European project in the light of the crises we are facing.

Farming is the EU’s largest integrated policy. We must not let the farmers fall by the wayside now. There can be no Europe without farmers!</literal>

               –Madam President, Commissioner Tajani, whom I particularly welcome, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, those of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), whom I thank for the support and cooperation they have provided from the very outset for my initiative of an oral question with a resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain. I would also thank all the political groups that have supported this oral question and worked determinedly on drafting the final text of this resolution.

This resolution is in response to the expectations of farmers, which have been put off for a long time, of reversing the growing imbalances in the food supply chain, in terms of both negotiating power between the parties and of income distribution. This has been provoked by the high concentration of Europe’s largest retailers and threatens the survival of farmers and suppliers in general, severely damaging the agricultural economy and rural societies.

The means proposed to this end are unequivocal identification of the bad practices in the food supply chain, support for its self-regulation through joint action by all stakeholders, demand for adequate legislation by the European Commission, not forgetting the commitment needed from Member States in this area, supervision and penalties. The Union legislation needed should take into account previous decisions of the European Parliament, both those that were implemented and those that have not been realised, to which will be added the responses considered here to be suited to the present situation as regards contractual relationships between producers, suppliers and retailers.

This resolution is not being set up against any of the partners in the food supply chain, but to give them closer relations and implement dialogue, so everyone’s contribution is required. This resolution is being set up against the unfair and abusive practices that have started to become established and is intended to introduce appropriate EU and national legislation, where necessary, without distorting the smooth running of the markets. As such, it is hoped it will encourage producers to have greater capacity for organising amongst themselves, and retailers to abandon dominating practices, such as the unilateral imposition of contractual conditions or practices relating to discounts, without increasing the price to the consumer but rather contributing to their having a real choice that is wider and of higher quality.

We are now awaiting the required initiative from the European Commission.</literal>

               –Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know it is increasingly hard to be a farmer in Europe. The figures speak for themselves. According to Eurostat, production costs have gone up 40% over the last decade, whilst prices have not increased by more than 25%.

However, it is not just upstream that farmers are being completely squeezed. Farmers downstream are also obliged to accept unimaginable prices, payment times and other contractual conditions, because of the disproportionate correlation of forces existing in the marketing chain.

I shall give the example of my own country, where the cooperative sector has little importance. Around 65% of sales of food products are concentrated in the hands of the five largest companies, with the figures much higher for some sectors, such as milk. Just last week, in my country, the authorities learned that 400 000 litres of milk on the marketing chain were being sold at below cost price.

As political decision makers, we need to ensure that agriculture remains a viable activity in Europe, producing good-quality foodstuffs and raw materials at fair prices that provide a living for farmers. To this end, there is a need for a sound common agricultural policy, but also for fair competition, as mentioned in the Treaty.

I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to follow up urgently the recommendations and suggestions formulated in the resolutions we are discussing here today, and for concrete proposals to be tabled as soon as possible.</literal>

               – Madam President, can I congratulate Mr Bové on his report on the farm input supply chain. It raises some very topical issues. We are all well aware that the rising cost of inputs – most notably for feed, fuel and fertiliser – is putting major pressure on farmers and continues to squeeze their margins in an economic climate that is already difficult, especially for the intensive sectors.

Specifically, the cost of feed has to be addressed; rising costs will force us to rethink our attitude, I believe, about soya imports from third countries and the problems associated with the protein deficit in the EU. I do not believe that domestic protein production can satisfy demand, especially if we wish to increase food production for reasons of food security. Moreover, rising food costs do not seem to result in higher farm gate prices and this has to be looked at for the benefit of both the consumer and the farmer. Large retailers must be prepared to cooperate with producers in order to ensure that the distribution of profits along the chain is equal and fair.

The EU imposes the strictest standards on animal welfare, environmental practices and food safety. I support the fact that the EU is the world leader in this regard, but I also think we have to find a balance between maintaining the highest standards and risking over-legislating our farmers out of business.

I fear the proposals from the Commission regarding the reform of the CAP go in that direction, especially in relation to greening and direct payments and the ridiculous set-aside proposal. With regard to the issue of imbalances in the food chain, it is clear that the power of retailers has grown to what some consider to be an unacceptable level. While there are some measures the EU can take, especially as regards transparency and profits in the chain, I think that farmers need to look at how they can organise themselves better and increase their bargaining power, whether through producer organisations or cooperatives.</literal>

               –Madam President, I should like to use all the time available to me for this debate now, if possible; all four minutes, since I have a further two minutes later.

I have a further two minutes and I should like to use them all together now, if possible. I would therefore ask you to set the clock to zero.

Madam President, Commissioner, the problem of farmers’ incomes is getting more serious, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized farmers and family farms, of which there are significant numbers in many Member States. Consumer prices do not reflect the prices paid to farmers for their products. The unsustainable increase in the costs of factors of production – fuel, feed, fertilisers, plant-health products, etc. – is happening at the same time as a persistent decline in the prices of products.

The consequences are the abandonment of agriculture, the unstoppable closure of farms, the desertification of the countryside, the concentration of production in the hands of large producers, and production that is increasingly intensive and geared towards exports. Imbalances between the Member States are growing; the food deficits and food dependence of countries with weaker production systems are growing; the threats to food security and sovereignty are growing.

None of this is new. All this is well known, and the causes of this profoundly negative development are also well known: the lack of instruments for regulating agricultural production, of regulation of the markets; the immeasurably increasing power of the major retailers and their abuses; the deregulation and liberalisation of international trade; the application of World Trade Organisation rules to agriculture; and the entry of speculators into the foodstuffs market. In short, the agricultural and trade policies in force: the common agricultural policy, the common commercial policy, and the patterns on which the single market has been established and is being deepened in the European Union.

Resolution of all these problems will not, therefore, be possible without profoundly changing these policies. There is a need for mechanisms regulating the food supply chain that defend producers – particularly small and medium-sized farmers, who promote employment in the countryside and bring it to life – and for reductions in food imports.

It is crucial to halt and reverse the present concentration of power in the hands of the major retailers and industry. There is a need for a decentralisation of the food supply chains, for support for and promotion of local production and consumption, for shorter food supply chains, and for local markets, including using innovative media like the Internet.

There is a need for measures intended to put a stop to dumping between Member States, as is happening in the milk sector, for example. There is a need for fair distribution of value added throughout the food supply chain.

We believe consideration should be given to the establishment of ceilings for companies’ profit margins using the price paid to producers as a benchmark, particularly for large supermarkets and retailers, and to putting a permanent stop to self-regulation, which is nothing short of a myth. There is a need to create and operate national systems for monitoring and shaping prices and price changes in retailers and large supermarkets, whilst steadfastly combating the current practices of cartelisation and price manipulation.

There is a need for a system of production quotas: a quota system adapted to the needs of each country and to its development in terms of production equipment, so as to enable the development of the Member States with higher deficits.

For reasons of environmental, economic and social sustainability, there is also a need to organise international trade in such a way that producers, products and countries complement each other, rather than competing, as currently happens. The vitality of the economic and social fabric in the primary sector is dependent on this, not just in Europe, but in other countries too, especially in developing countries.

These, amongst many others, were some of the proposals included in the resolution tabled by our group. Unfortunately, we cannot find many of them in the report or in the other resolutions. We therefore hope that some of these proposals may be adopted here today.</literal>

               –Madam President, if we are talking about the European Union as a union of equal states, then it is precisely this policy of equality that we should pursue consistently. Direct payments to farmers producing agricultural products in European Union Member States must not vary, with some being paid two, three or even four times as much as others, because it is precisely these differences that orchestrate the problems which will prevent us from ever achieving balance in the food supply chain. Food production and supply chain costs are increasing for various reasons, such as increasing plant health, animal welfare, environmental protection, hygiene and food safety requirements, which are all the same for all Member States. However, the different levels of payments in European Union Member States are marginalising food producers so much that fair competition is completely out of reach.

Attention must also be drawn to another important issue – large distribution companies currently dominate food markets, and prices paid to farmers in the food supply chain are constantly being cut. At the same time, production costs continue to rise. Farmers are not receiving sufficient income for their products, while big commercial monopolies are making huge profits at the farmers’ expense. Due to the significant variation between the price paid to farmers and the final price paid by consumers, as well as the lack of transparency, the difference in competitive conditions and, in some cases, abuse in the food supply chain, farming is becoming no longer viable and farmers’ survival is under threat. I believe that the primary task of the Commission and the Member States today is to guarantee that competition rules, which operate on principles of equality, are upheld throughout the upstream and downstream food market chain.</literal>

               – Madam President, oh to be a Commissioner and be able to have so much time to speak! It was good to hear your fulsome response, Commissioner. I have less time but I will be quite blunt. I would like you to take the comments in this debate as armour and weapons into your struggles on this matter. This House is united about one issue, which is that there is a problem at both ends – and, indeed, in the centre – of the food supply chain. The Bové report, which was an initiative of mine in the EPP Group – and I thank Mr Bové for his work on it – deals with the farm input problem. It is serious, and you have acknowledged that. At the other end, we have had the excellent work of my colleague, Mrs Patrão Neves, on the imbalance of power and the need to look at this.

I am particularly pleased by your words, and I quote you here, that you will ‘reserve the right to legislate’. I think the stakeholders should listen with concern and be prepared to face legislation if there is no cooperation and effective change on this issue.

Commissioner, you mentioned the financial services sector. I think you were right to do that. There is a huge parallel between what has happened in financial services – to the discredit of the European Union – and what is happening in the food supply chain. My interest in this House is in the food supply chain. Food security is fundamental. Are you, as Commissioner, prepared to watch over the destruction of this if we do not take action now?

Let me warn you that, though we have been up early for this debate, there are others in the food chain who have been up much earlier and are taking from the pockets of producers, both their pockets, to cushion their own profits. Some of the practices that are going on you do not even know and we do not fully understand. There is something rotten in this system, and unless politicians have the bottle to call it rotten, there will be no change. Take this debate to the Commission and take action.</literal>

               –Madam President, allow me to make three comments which relate mainly to the farm input supply chain, but which also affect the food production chain. Firstly, I should like to emphasise that the smooth operation of the food market is inextricably bound up with the smooth operation of the farm input supply market and vice versa. Therefore, regulations are needed that will safeguard transparency in input pricing and the application of, and compliance with, competition rules both by the input supply chain and in the agri-food chain.

Secondly, I should like to point out that the quality of traditional crop seeds should be linked to the cultural heritage of the Member States, in the same way as the agricultural product quality policy. I therefore think that it is important to create a European bank for seeds to store and maintain the genetic variety of traditional plants and combat the current loss of biodiversity in traditional varieties.

Thirdly, I should like to point out that rational use of inputs and resources requires far more than the application of rules. It requires a change of attitude, knowledge and skills on the part of farmers, so that they can adopt the most productive, viable and innovative cultivation systems under the circumstances. As we all understand, that depends on both innovative and institutional improvements and a high standard of training. I trust that the new common agricultural policy will take all this into account.</literal>

               –Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to praise Mr Bové for the work he has done. Now, I would like to talk in very simplified terms, that is to say, my message is perhaps not directed at my fellow Members, but at those who are currently buying their own food.

The big problem for the EU’s farmers, and perhaps their only economic problem, is that they are shamelessly poorly paid for their work. The input chain is extremely large and, I would like to point out, extremely profitable. The food industry is reasonably profitable, and in the trading chain, it is, in fact, quite easy these days to become a prosperous small business.

In the midst of this gigantic chain is the individual farmer, and even if we regard him or her as a large farmer, he or she is an almost invisible link in the large food supply chain, despite the fact that it is the farmer who is the really important converter of inputs into raw materials for the next link in the chain.

I would like to ask you to imagine for a moment that if farmers were sufficiently well paid for what they sold on the market, then the EU’s income subsidies could, in fact, be converted into investment capital for rural development, the environment, climate change, animal care and infrastructure. Think what resources we would have available to us the day that farmers were paid a reasonable amount for the work they do!</literal>

               – Madam President, I will be no exception in congratulating my colleague, José Bové, for this very timely and very powerful report. It pulls together a number of the interlocking and mutually reinforcing factors which are impacting on our food supply chain and making the lives of European and global farmers more difficult. Indeed, there are times when the economics of farming are not so much a science as more of a voodoo cult. It is amazing that anybody is actually in farming at all and that we have any food to eat.

The fact is that the increased concentration of market power downstream of farming, in processing industries, trade companies and supermarkets, and upstream of farming, in terms of increasing costs for fertilisers, energy, feed, seed, water, loans and land rent, is undermining the proper functioning of the food supply chain in Europe. Farmers are facing a squeeze between rising costs for input and low farm gate prices.

For those colleagues – usually those not present in these debates – who have suggested that the free market is working, I have some statistics from the Scottish Agricultural College report on power in agriculture – actual statistics on market concentration – showing that four companies worldwide account for 75-90%, by some measures, of global grain trade, seven companies control all fertiliser supply, five companies share 68% of the global agrochemical market, and three companies control almost 50% of the proprietary seeds market. If you add to that the supermarkets’ and processors’ power, it really is surprising that our farmers are in business at all. So to those who would say that the free market in agriculture is working – well, prima facie, no it is not.

We saw what happened – as other colleagues have mentioned – with the breakdown of the interbank lending market earlier in this economic crisis. It is the poorest who are hit hardest, and our citizens are very much in the frame for this. So I was delighted, Commissioner, to hear your fulsome presentation this morning, and I hope you will gather from this debate that this House is looking for more action from the Commission, not less. We are your ally in this and, if anything, we want to see more urgent activity from the Commission on the many issues raised in this report.

We want to see further action because this is not going to go away or get better. Quite the reverse – the market is concentrating further day by day in a world where we are increasingly seeing instability in energy prices, global instability and its political knock-on effects, and climate change making parts of the world wetter, parts of the world drier, and all of the world more climatically unstable. We are not going to see our food supply chain getting calmer.

We need to act on this urgently. CAP reform has never been more urgent and this report deserves to be absolutely fundamental in all our minds as we take forward the CAP reform project with you, Commissioner. We look forward to that effort.</literal>

               –Madam President, during the course of the previous term, we managed, in this House, to adopt a resolution calling for opposition to the abuse by major retail chains of their dominant position in respect to their consumers and, most importantly, in respect to farmers. I was one of the co-authors of this document and I remember that while organising a press conference after its adoption, some of the agricultural organisations that had supported the collection of signatures for the declaration even asked not to be mentioned publicly, fearing potential reprisal from major retail chains. This illustrates the scale of the problem. Both in EU law as well as in the law of the Member States, legal instruments exist which allow us to deal with the situation effectively, and these legal instruments should be applied.

I would like to draw attention to distortions in competition which result from the unequal rights of our farmers. This manifests itself both in external competition, in the area of unequal standards and the higher requirements that our farmers face in comparison to importers, as well as in internal competition, in the area of unequal subsidies. This is a very serious problem, which also distorts the agricultural market of the European Union.</literal>

               –Madam President, I should also like to commend Mr Bové on his report. One can sense that it has been drawn up by a real farmer, who feels the pain of farmers. For my own part, I should like to say that a situation has arisen throughout the world where agricultural products are now used both in food and in energy production. Grain is used for bioethanol, rape for biodiesel, maize for biogas, and so on. As a result, financial resources that used to circulate on the fossil fuel market are now also flowing into the food production sector and are causing excessive price fluctuations. In my view, the European Commission should, as a matter of urgency, pay more attention to these issues, and should, as swiftly as possible, develop a mechanism to prevent financial speculation on the food market based on this factor. Too little thought is being devoted to questions of increasing soil fertility. I think that the European Commission should draw up and adopt a package of administrative measures to increase farmers’ economic autonomy and use of the required resources. Honest, fair and economically justified direct payments are one of the possibilities for farmers to reduce the negative effect of fluctuations in the supply of resources on stability in agricultural production. The utmost attention must therefore be paid to these matters, and we must demand accountability. Thank you.</literal>

               – Madam President, during my farming lifetime, I have seen wheat yields triple, and during my farming lifetime, I have seen sugar beet yields triple. In addition to that, those sugar beet have gone from being randomly monogerm to consistently monogerm, and all that is down to the efforts of plant breeders. They have to be rewarded for the work that they do. They are in great competition with other plant breeders and the farmer, I can assure you, is the most brutal customer of the lot. If he does not like a variety, he will drop it like a stone. The price of failure for a plant breeder is very high indeed: it is 10 years’ work straight down the drain.

Somebody was talking about maintaining seed banks. I can assure you that the seed breeders themselves do that. Actually, seed is one of the farm inputs that farmers have a huge degree of control over, and in the UK, a farmer has three choices. He can either maintain an old variety on which no royalty is payable, or he can multiply up a new variety. He will then have to declare that he has done so and pay a modest acreage royalty. He can expect to be inspected, or he can simply buy a bag of seed where the royalty is part of the price. All of these things he can do. This works well in the UK. I do not see the necessity to call on the Commission to interfere in this in any way at all.</literal>

  – Madam President, firstly, may I thank the rapporteur for his work on this issue and the focus that he brings to a wide variety of problems that farmers are facing today. Whilst the rapporteur highlights generally the problems in terms of cost of production versus farm gate prices, in Northern Ireland – despite these difficulties – agriculture continues to contribute to the economy. We have heard colleagues say today that this really is quite a miracle, given the problems that farmers face.

However, the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland has grown significantly, accounts for 20% of sales from the manufacturing industry and now, in a very small region, provides 50 000 direct jobs. We should recognise the absolute importance of this industry to our economy. It is an industry which has proved resilient in difficult economic conditions and should provide further private-sector growth if given the proper support and freedom from oppressive legislation. There is no doubt that many of the issues raised by the report are valuable, but I believe that the greatest contribution that we can make to a sustainable and competitive sector is in producing a common agricultural policy that sees food production and European food security as its aim and objective.

Over recent weeks, I have been talking to farmers in my own constituency and they see the proposals from the Commission as complex, overbearing in terms of environmental objectives and favouring landowners over active food-producing farmers. In our discussions on CAP reform, if we miss the opportunity to provide an environment for increased productivity and one which provides food and supply security, we will only continue to increase price volatility for farmers and consumers.

Also, Commissioner, I was interested in your brief run-down on some of the common agricultural policy proposals. You mentioned specifically crop rotation, as has been envisaged in the Pillar One proposal. In Northern Ireland, this is seen as much too prescriptive and almost certainly will put small mixed farms out of work. It is simply not workable.

In my own country, can I urge the UK Government to get on with its plans for the supermarket ombudsman and to give that ombudsman a range of powers which will actually tackle the issue.</literal>

  –Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bové for his report and Ms Patrão Neves for the initiative for this motion for a resolution today. There are two developments that are worrying me. The first of these, Commissioner, is the growing gap between input and farm gate prices. The second is the situation right throughout the supply chain.

Commissioner, I have just looked this up. On 27 July 1961, aged 14, I got my licence to drive a tractor, and my first job was to take grain to the brewery. At that time, 100 kg cost the equivalent of EUR 25. On my way home, I bought a newspaper, which cost me the equivalent of EUR 0.05. Today, cereal costs not EUR 25, but EUR 20, while the newspaper costs EUR 0.70 instead of EUR 0.05. If grain prices had followed the same trajectory as newspaper prices, consumers would now have to pay EUR 350 for 100 kg.

You can see from these figures what Europe’s farmers are providing and what contribution they have made to giving our consumers cheap prices for food.

What annoys me, and I am personally the chair of a farming cooperative, is the issue of terms of payment. Given the time constraints, I will limit myself to that. It has become a bad habit for the supermarket chains to saddle these farming cooperatives with ever longer payment terms. Once upon a time, it was 24 days. Now, even in Germany, it is often 60. In other words, if we deliver fresh milk, we make 30 deliveries before we get payment for the first one. Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action in this regard. We need to tackle these payment terms in the same way as we tackled roaming charges. That is the only way this situation will be rectified. I beg you to take action.</literal>

  –Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the report by Mr Bové, whom I thank for his work, Europe is focusing decisively on establishing a legislative framework to ensure fairness and greater transparency in relations within the agri-food industry.

In this field, the ideas and requests approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are very much to be welcomed. Higher levels of transparency in prices, the reduction of the costs of production inputs and more effective management of energy and natural resources within the industry are just a few of the most important points.

Madam President, on these grounds, and taking advantage of the presence of Vice-President Tajani, I think it appropriate to recall the central point of the joint resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain, to which my fellow Members have also referred: a European system to harmonise the length of time taken for payments in commercial transactions between agri-food producers and the distribution system.

Mr Tajani, we can no longer allow distortions of competition between European producers; it is no longer acceptable to have different national legal systems that regulate deadlines for payment, contractual agreements and discounting practices differently. There is a lack of territorial homogeneity exacerbating this phase of extreme market volatility where sharp price rises are not translating into higher margins for farmers; they, on the contrary, see their incomes dropping lower and lower.

Mr Tajani, we in Parliament are ready to support a legislative proposal that goes in this direction and I know of the work that you are doing with the high-level group. I therefore sincerely hope that we may soon see a legislative proposal on harmonisation of the distribution systems in Europe.</literal>

  – Madam President, this is a very timely debate, and I would add my congratulations to José Bové for a well balanced report that highlights the real problems that farmers face because, as other speakers have pointed out, on the one hand, farmers are selling their produce to a handful of very powerful multinational retailers, and, on the other hand, they are purchasing their inputs from a handful of very powerful agrochemical or agro-industry multinational suppliers. The result, of course, is that farmers are squeezed from both sides by these huge and powerful companies.

This highlights the urgent need for action in the CAP reform and in other areas where the Commission is taking action to try and help this matter. We need to strengthen the hand of farmers when it comes to negotiating (a) with the retailers, and (b) with their input suppliers. If we can achieve that, what will then happen is a better return for farmers, a better margin, and less reliance on the need for taxpayers’ support in the future.

There is one particular area that I think needs immediate action from the Commission, and that is in regard to the fertiliser market. If I could give you the example, Commissioner, of the UK fertiliser market, there is a monopoly manufacturer for nitrogen fertiliser called GrowHow. It is 50% owned by its largest competitor Yara, which is the largest fertiliser manufacturer in the world. The other half of GrowHow is owned by CF Industries, which is the largest manufacturer of nitrogen-based fertilisers in North America. Surely this level of consolidation means there is little real competition in the UK marketplace. I suspect this is replicated throughout the rest of Europe. The only competition they face is from the blenders, but they, unfortunately, have to buy their nitrogen from that same supplier.

So between 2003 and 2009, output prices for agricultural products increased by 35%, their inputs increased by 42%, but fertiliser increased by 173%. That is evidence that the market is failing. Commissioner, could you give me a guarantee that you will investigate this matter and ask the Competition Commissioner to look closely at how the fertiliser market is operating in the EU?</literal>

  –Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as early as 2010, we adopted a report by José Bové which focused on the market players to whom farmers sell their produce: the processing and distribution industries. Now we are turning our attention further up the supply chain, with rising commodity prices on the one hand and, on the other, farmers’ increasing dependence on a highly concentrated supply sector. Mr Lyon spoke about this just now.

The latest Bové report extends a helping hand to active farmers and it sets out a strategy for an agricultural policy that is more socially responsible and that ensures a decent income for farmers. It is also a policy that is greener. A policy with an even greater concern for sustainable agricultural practices. A policy that also makes a concrete contribution to the fight against climate change. A policy that is also directed against the ruthless monopolies of seed and food giants.

This report forges a close alliance between this Parliament and active farmers, and defends the autonomy of farmers and consumers and, as such, it deserves our full support. Congratulations, José Bové!</literal>

  –Madam President, European agriculture is going through a difficult period because, among other things, the entire EU has expanded dramatically over the past decade through the accession of new Member States. Competition on the agricultural market has grown considerably, and all farmers in Europe are now feeling the competitive pressure. Many of them are coping well with this, but some are unable to face the pressure and are gradually leaving the sector. This is natural and proper, however, and any effort to prevent it would, in my view, be doomed to fail. We must, on the contrary, assist the agricultural sector by removing the unnecessary regulations and quotas which hinder agricultural development. Ending the quotas and ceilings on wine, milk, sugar and other items will also provide an opportunity for growth in the agricultural sector. It is these quotas that are a barrier to the growth of European agriculture, and it is also necessary to facilitate the operation of alternative distribution channels, such as farm sales or the farmers’ markets that have seen successfully rising sales in the Czech Republic and elsewhere.</literal>

They were necessary after the Second World War, when there was a need to stabilise European agriculture, but they are no longer necessary today, in my view, and we must start to eliminate them gradually, and I also believe, on the contrary, that this will lead to a better allocation of capital and the better functioning of the market.</literal>

  –Madam President, in an effort to keep the prices of agricultural produce stable, we are looking for a variety of measures that could eliminate the adverse impact of rising input prices on agricultural production.

In view of the fact that we cannot realistically maintain prices in respect of energy, machinery, compound feed, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds or water at a stable level in the long term, I am under no illusions that our efforts would be successful. In an open market environment, it is always justified that higher input prices and production costs are reflected in the cost price of the product. I therefore think that, in our efforts to solve the problems of the food chain, we should focus more on addressing the imbalances and inequalities in the relationship between agricultural primary production and the processing sector or retail chains, because it is in this area in particular that the most significant price distortions occur, to the detriment of primary production.

I do not claim that all is well in the area of inputs for agricultural enterprises, such as the supply of seeds. In my opinion, however, the most significant price distortions are in the chain between primary production and processors or trade.</literal>

  –Madam President, I find it very positive that we are now looking into the problems upstream of farm production in a new own-initiative report. In so doing, I believe that we should pay particular attention to the reduction of input costs. It is a well-known fact that, over recent years, these have risen disproportionately in relation to agricultural earnings. Thus, for example, energy costs in agriculture rose by around 60% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices only rose by 25%. The rapporteur’s suggestion of setting up a price monitoring agency is certainly the right way to go. We have to succeed in increasing competition in the input sector, thus bringing about more attractive prices for farmers.

It is well known that farmers, for their part, are already attempting to work together more closely in a number of areas and thus exploit their potential when it comes to efficiency savings. In the medium and the long term, however, it will be necessary to provide farmers – especially those who farm organically – with a better price environment for their products so that we can ensure their long-term survival, especially in outlying alpine regions.</literal>

  –Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to thank my colleague, Ms Patrão Neves, because, during the last few months, she has defended against all opposition this resolution which we are debating today and which we will vote on later. Ms Patrão Neves, with the support of the Group of the European People’s Party, has had to face many obstacles and I should like to congratulate her on the work which has brought us to this point.

Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, farmers received 50% of the final price paid by consumers; but today, in many cases, they receive less than 10%. At the same time, in 20 years, the market share for distribution chains has risen from 21.7% to 70%. Something is going on, and it is quite obvious.

Measures must be adopted to ensure that food supply chains are more equitable, more equal and fairer.

Firstly, the security networks provided by the common agricultural policy to ensure fair prices must be improved. We need an EU framework to guarantee fair relationships and avoid abuse. We must define and prohibit abusive practices within these margins. We must make production more concentrated, encouraging producers’, farmers’ and livestock breeders’ organisations. We must also ensure fair competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities. I am referring to those producers outside of the European Union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality, food security, animal welfare and all these issues which are so essential that we require our producers to meet such standards.

Where do we do all of this? Well, in the next CAP reform, of course. We must improve contractual relations in this CAP reform. The aim will be to improve the position of the primary sector within the chain, improve distribution trade policy, avoid the constant increase in food speculation, take into account and improve those margins which are causing a rise in non-agricultural costs, and, finally, assure producers that all products on the EU market meet the same quality standards.</literal>

  –Madam President, Commissioner, this is not the first time we have debated inequality within food supply chains and, whether we are talking about farm input or the final product, primary producers are always the weak link.

We are currently in the middle of a debate on CAP reform, and the greatest worry for the sector is the serious problem in terms of prices. Production costs are rising higher and higher and producers are unable to pass them on in their prices.

For this reason, it is necessary, at Community level, to strengthen existing legislation on agricultural contracts, inter-branch organisations and producers’ organisations, as well as promoting instruments such as price observatories, which analyse the price formation process through an analysis of costs, processes and margins, and, of course, to find a balance between the regulation of the agri-food sector and competition rules.

In this connection, I want to highlight how essential it is that the Commission adapts the scope and application of these rules with regard to agriculture so that producers or their inter-branch organisations can effectively improve their negotiating position.</literal>

  –Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need functioning markets with scope for competition in Europe. We will only achieve this, however, when everyone has equal rights. The role of farmers in the market is that of relatively small sole traders. Upstream and downstream of them, by contrast, we often see quite large business structures. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is, for once, looking into the market not only from the consumer point of view, but also from that of producers. If we have imbalances, we need to find ways to tackle them without giving rise to excessive bureaucracy and without creating new imbalances elsewhere. We all know how sensitively markets react. In these times of the debt crisis, in particular, that is something we see day in, day out. It is therefore important to test the waters carefully if we intervene.

Markets need sensible frameworks in order to facilitate a minimum level of balance. However, they also need enough freedom to act and to be able to do so. Agriculture cannot be excepted from this principle. Only a balance of freedom and responsibility will enable all market participants to make the most of their advantages and thus help bring about long-term growth and prosperity.</literal>

  – Madam President, Commissioner, our farmers are being squeezed between ever-rising input prices, on the one hand, and very tough competitive market conditions for agricultural commodities, on the other. Faced with this problem, the Commission has two options. They should be reluctant to regulate markets – that is usually heavy-handed and rarely effective – but they should offer encouragement and support to the industry by indicating best practice on all sides.

There are three things you can do here, Commissioner. Firstly, you should encourage farmers to cooperate with one another: by working together, they can exploit their strengths to buy inputs better, process production better and thereby add value. You can empower farmers by ensuring that there is transparent market information always available; and you can enable farmers by amending competition law, promoting codes of conduct, illustrating best practice and simplifying the common agricultural policy.

I am disappointed that the Commissioner’s proposals for CAP reform fail to recognise adequately the strategic importance of a viable, competitive agricultural sector. How fortunate the Commissioner is that he has José Bové here today to offer him sound practical advice. It is a good report, José. Thank you.</literal>

The distribution of value in the food supply chain is far from fair. Mr Bové’s report and the oral questions have touched on a sore spot. The primary producer is caught in the middle between highly concentrated suppliers of raw materials and powerful buyers. The primary producer cannot translate higher input costs into higher output prices. Primary producers remain a highly vulnerable group when it comes to distribution in the value chain and that is exactly why they need to forge a strong alliance, as Mr Ashworth said just now.

Can the Commission clarify how much scope the legislation currently provides specifically for arrangements to recoup the cost of sustainability initiatives? How much scope is there for self-regulation? What measures does the Commission have in place for addressing the issue of buyers wielding an undesirable level of dominance?</literal>

  –Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Maria Patrão Neves for her excellent work. We welcome the general consensus reached on this text. The topic warranted it.

For years, farmers’ share of revenue has been falling. As the statistics show, this decrease is not caused by one single entity, but by the producers’ lack of structural weight in the food chain.

Many of us have repeated this time and time again, but I do not know if that is good or bad. It has been said time and time again: we must give producers their deserved role in the food chain, one that is, above all, proportionate to their importance. The rules of competition should be applied in the same way to everyone and should not lead to this serious imbalance that we have highlighted. However, the reality is clearly very different. This unfair treatment is largely due to the diverse way in which the national competition authorities apply the European rules.

As Members of the European Parliament, we see what is happening on the ground, we act as intermediaries and we can vouch for the difficulties encountered by many of our farmers or producers’ organisations when they want to unite in order to deal with processors, distributors and even their own competitors. As regards concentration, in particular, the definition of the relevant market varies from one country to another.

When producers want to come together and combine their weight, some national competition authorities prevent them from doing so. They believe that the national market could not cope with that concentration and the significant weight of that new organisation. On the contrary, in other Member States, the opposite happens. Such groupings are authorised because the market taken into consideration, the supposedly relevant market, is the European market. Their weight is thus proportionally smaller and their position is not considered to be dominant. This situation is clearly untenable.

The Commission and the Court of Justice, as guardians of the Community’s legislation and its uniform application, must ensure that the national authorities do not keep producer organisations in an inferior position that puts a strain on their negotiating capacity.</literal>

The two other large sectors are concentrated, highly concentrated in fact. That is the case for the distribution sector. Producers, however, are relatively deprived and very dispersed.

We therefore have to try to organise them as we have just done with the report on milk by Mr Nicholson. We tried to give them more power. I do not think that that is enough. In my view, there will be two important aspects. The first is that they will have to be organised but monitored by the public authority because – as one of my colleagues just said – we will need a body to monitor prices and margins as the public authority alone can ensure a balance between the various stakeholders. The second, in my opinion, is that we will have to stop treating competition as sacrosanct. What is important, above all, is the welfare of each of the stakeholders in the food chain, which ensures the welfare of all. That takes priority over the rules of competition.</literal>

  – Madam President, it is one of the great misconceptions of agriculture that higher food prices automatically translate into higher farm incomes. However, it is the experience of farmers in my own Member State, Ireland, that they are not getting fair play or a fair return in the food supply chain.

In 2010, average farm incomes in Ireland were EUR 17 700, or just over 50% of the average industrial wage. Since 2000, the cost of on-farm production has increased by over 37%, despite major efficiencies at farm level. At the same time, the price paid to farmers has increased by only 14%. I have no doubt that this imbalance is replicated for farmers right across the EU.

It is clear that primary producers are being squeezed from both sides of the food supply chain. On the one side, they receive low-grade farm gate prices due to the strong position of processors and retailers, and, on the other side, they pay high input prices due to increased concentration of input companies. Total input costs for EU farmers rose by almost 40% between 2000 and 2010 and costs continue to increase for farmers year on year. The upper pressure on these prices will rise further as a result of resource scarcity and a growing demand for food. On the other side of the chain, retailers have used their powers over farmers to implement a number of methods such as ‘hello money’, ‘pay to play money’, payment delays, shelf space pricing and carrying the costs of discount campaigns, which cut away at the returns of farmers and buy their produce in unfair and unbalanced conditions.

This is about fair return for fair work, making a viable living from work that brings added value to the environment, delivers food security and puts food on the table of the European citizens. The retailers, processors, food suppliers and consumers are key stakeholders in the food supply chain, but so is the farmer. I think we should remember that.</literal>

  – Madam President, the rising cost of food is of great concern, particularly at this time of economic hardship.

From an economic and monetary affairs perspective, we will deal in detail with the issue of commodity derivatives, and agricultural markets in general, in the regulation on markets in financial instruments and the Market Abuse Regulation over the course of this year. We need, however, to ensure that our financial services legislation is joined up with our wider agricultural policies. The key will be transparency. Ultimately, we do not know what role financial market participants are playing in the world’s commodity markets because there is a lack of transparency in the trading process.

This report makes clear just how many factors influence the price of food, yet it is easy for politicians directly to blame banks and hedge funds for price volatility. This is not a two-dimensional discussion, and the Commission needs to look for more sophisticated tools to remove the opacity in commodity markets and give financial regulators a full toolbox. They really need to clamp down on any abusive behaviour as and when it may occur.

Nevertheless, we need to proceed with caution, as food producers need to be able to continue to use agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge their business exposures. Financial participants should, however, reduce – not cause – volatility in our prices.</literal>

  –Madam President, the extremely difficult situation facing agricultural producers puts the survival of many agricultural holdings at risk. Protecting the interests of farmers is therefore a matter which should be prioritised. We should focus, in particular, on small-scale family agricultural holdings as well as on holdings situated in Less Favoured Areas (LFA), especially mountainous or remote areas, where – due to the higher costs of production and energy used for transport or field work – the situation is particularly severe.

As we know, the current situation is influenced by an increase in the price of raw materials, energy, fertilisers and other means of production. We also need to consider, however, the exceptionally powerful monopolistic activities prevalent in the market for means of production, the processing market and in trade. Therefore, I share the opinion that this issue should be dealt with by European and national competition bodies. I also support the initiatives aimed at increasing the transparency of farm input prices, as well as the European Food Prices Monitoring Tool set up by Eurostat. What we need is a strong legal system that monitors and regulates similar practices.

The agricultural market requires a degree of intervention. Given the specific character of agricultural production, which depends on weather conditions and biology, full self-regulation of the agricultural market is not feasible. All the more so, since the agricultural market has been the subject of increased speculation, the results of which we have felt very strongly. We should also develop local markets, food fairs and other forms of trade, which will shorten the chain from food producers to food consumers. This will not only positively influence the quality of agricultural produce, but also contribute to reduced prices and increased benefits for consumers as well as for agricultural producers.</literal>

  –Madam President, for many years, I have been taking part in debates devoted to the difficult situation facing European Union farmers. Unfortunately, it is with regret that I have to say that many of the European Commission’s announcements heard in the last few years, also in this House, have not been put into effect to this day. Farmers were promised a long time ago that they would have special agreements, which would guarantee continuous collection of produce on the one hand, and suitable prices on the other. Equally, relations with suppliers are deteriorating continuously. The plight of farmers is truly tragic. Their attempts to achieve specialisation and higher productivity resulted in their becoming dependent on suppliers in recent years, with the latter dictating prices as well as payment and delivery deadlines. We have to change this situation. We hear words to this effect time and time again. I would like to put the following question to the European Commission: when exactly can we expect proper regulation with regard to agreements and contracts, on the one hand, and with regard to relations between farmers and suppliers, on the other?</literal>

  – Madam President, I want to focus on the energy aspects of Mr Bové’s excellent report because improving energy efficiency on our farms is an absolute imperative. I would caution, however, against the race for erecting massive wind turbines on farms. In Scotland right now, the modern equivalent of snake oil salesmen are knocking on doors throughout the countryside trying to persuade hard-pressed farmers to part with vast sums of cash in exchange for having one of these industrial monsters erected on their land with the promise of pots of gold.

However, as the recent storms have demonstrated, these turbines are often subject to catastrophic failure, and even when they are working, they only produce a trickle of electricity. As a result, many farmers in Scotland have found that they have rusting hulks on their land which are earning nothing and costing them a fortune. Instead of having signs on farm gates that say ‘Beware of the bull’, farmers should have signs on their gates which say ‘Beware of the bullshit’!</literal>

  –Mr President, the cost pressure to which our agricultural producers are exposed is enormous. Agricultural inputs – meaning seeds, fertilisers and animal feed, but also machinery – are getting ever more expensive. One of the biggest factors behind the rising costs, however, is energy costs. There is an urgent need for an action plan in the energy sector, not only in order to get to grips with the costs, but also to reduce dependence, and this urgent need is a call to action for all areas of politics. There is a major potential in renewable energy sources such as wind, hydropower and biomass from sustainable raw materials. This renewable energy mix can fill the energy gap on a permanent basis.

We need to mobilise all available resources, while at the same time increasing efficiency. Improved resource management in respect of humus and water, energy and nutrients cannot remain just an empty slogan.

Another uncertainty factor for operators is the massive price fluctuations. Those running businesses need to be equipped to plan for the long term. A monitoring system for input prices could be helpful in that respect.

Excessive speculation on food commodities is an unacceptable factor. We cannot allow speculators to gamble on higher food prices. This problem is well enough known and it will not go away by itself. The effect of this can be felt by both agricultural producers, through low revenues, and consumers, through higher prices on the shop shelves. Higher food prices are not reflected in farming incomes. Instead, the beneficiaries are to be found at the end of the supply chain, which is to say, the processing industry and retailers. There needs to be a fair division of profits right along the production chain.

Another cause of high costs that needs to be combated is Europe’s enormous dependence on supplies of raw materials and input products imported from third countries. We can only master the economic and environmental challenges and the extreme cost pressure in agriculture through long-term investment in raw material production, farm development, research and innovation.

These approaches must also be reflected in the reform of the common agricultural policy. The new common agricultural policy must enable farmers to achieve the full potential of their businesses.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to see this topic addressed in plenary and I would like to offer my thanks to Mr Bové. It really is a very important issue that we are debating today, be it for producers, processors, for trade or for consumers.

Production costs for farmers have risen sharply over recent years. Farmers can primarily feel the increasing overheads when it comes to energy bills and agricultural inputs. The heavy concentration of food retailing, above all, makes it more difficult for producers to obtain good prices for their products.

Although the mark-up between the primary and the end product is sometimes considerable, not much of that reaches producers, as some of the margin is lost to each of the various processing steps. Politicians can intervene in competition policy, but we must be careful when doing so, and, in certain areas, we have to trust to market forces.

I consider it important to let consumers know that buying regional products from their producers or makers supports both the farmers and the local economy. That is where I see our role. We should intervene in this connection, be it with money or with political instruments. I believe strengthening regionalism provides a tool to do this. In the reform of the common agricultural policy, we need to make other tools available.

For me as a Social Democrat, it is important that access to wholesome food at reasonable prices should be guaranteed for all, while, at the same time, farmers must be able to receive a fair and reasonable income for their work. This demand requires us not to shirk our responsibility, and indeed to live up to it.

Every time we act, we need to ask ourselves if we are living up to these demands. If not, the result will be social unrest in the long run. Farmers and consumers are in the same boat. Let us ensure that that boat never sinks.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis and the fall in consumption have dealt yet another blow to farms and producers.

The problem of farmers’ incomes is becoming ever more severe and is affecting small and medium-sized enterprises, the family-run businesses which do not have the strength to fight the arrogance of large retailers. Today, with this resolution, we are clearly saying that Europe must take action to correct these distortions.

We must ensure transparent contractual relations between producers and distributors in order to guarantee a decent, adequate income for those who work the soil. We must also prevent price fluctuations creating advantages for just a few, because currently, when prices rise, it is large retailers that profit, and when they fall, it is the farm workers that grow poorer. In order to achieve this, we must ensure that the industry becomes smaller and that there is fair competition within it.

It is not possible, as happens to me every Saturday, when I go shopping, to find extra virgin olive oil sold in the supermarket for EUR 2 per litre bottle when the price paid to producers by wholesale traders is EUR 2.35. Furthermore, we need transparency for consumers and clear information to guarantee quality against counterfeit products. Staying on the subject of extra virgin olive oil, we have asked, in a question that has received broad backing, for the level of alkyl esters and methyl esters to be reduced in order to prevent mixes of other oils, refined and deodorised, being added to oil sold as extra virgin. Placing these on the market contributes to driving down the price of high-quality oil.

Commissioner, I hope that in relation to these points and this request for an amendment to Regulation No 61/2011 to reduce the levels of alkyl esters and methyl esters, you will make a clear and precise commitment on behalf of the Commission to reduce the presence of these counterfeit oils in extra virgin oil on the market.

In addition, we must ensure that production costs are driven down. I welcome your openness, but I call for the idea to be endorsed in the next CAP of ensuring that renewable energy generation facilities be installed in every farm. These would be intended to provide for the energy requirements of the farm itself, reducing costs and COemissions, and providing support to producers and small farms. What could be greener than a provision like this?

Commissioner, we must act quickly and take appropriate measures, because rural abandonment and soil desertification are no longer risks that need to be averted, but actual facts that need to be combated.</literal>

  –Mr President, Commissioner, if the proposals of the Bové report are implemented at the same speed as that at which Mr Silvestris made his speech, the future is bright.

I will start by discussing food prices. Over recent days, we have talked and talked about how a third of food in Europe finds its way, unused, into the rubbish. We have been discussing our failure to achieve the biodiversity targets. We have been talking about how we find ourselves in an energy crisis. We have been talking about the fact that many Europeans cannot afford food at the moment. We have also been talking – and quite rightly so – about how those who produce food can no longer make a living by doing so and how we can talk of a large-scale abandonment of farming in Europe.

What we have in its place is a concentration in production, in production facilities and, above all, in retail. If I take Austria as an example, we can see that 77% of the retail trade is in the hands of just three companies. What we do not want to see, on the other hand, is a concentration of this kind in agriculture. We want to retain the biodiversity here, too, in terms of types of business. We need these opportunities to produce healthy, safe, hygienically sound food.

There are suggestions in the Bové report, and the reform of the common agricultural policy provides further opportunities. Let us effect implementation at the same speed that Mr Silvestris spoke to the House today!</literal>

  –Mr President, I must mention the draft resolution being debated. In my view, the key elements in this draft are those which concern improving the farmers’ position in a better internal organisation. Providing support to producer organisations is the soundest way to enable producers to sell their produce under decent terms. At the same time, I do not believe that we need to be wary about legislating on the food supply chain relationship as long as future legislation is based on objective factors. It is not reasonable for us to continue to rely on self-regulation of this relationship between farmers and retailers, at least at the moment, as borne out by the experiences so far. Farmers need specific measures and cannot afford to idly wait to go bankrupt.

This is why I am advocating the adoption of paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution in its entirety, which is extremely reasonable and even envisages that future legislative measures have to be adopted only if they are absolutely necessary, and that these measures must not distort the smooth operation of the markets.</literal>

  –Mr President, it was a year ago in September that Parliament adopted the Bové report, following an in-depth debate in which I, as the individual in charge of this matter for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, was heavily involved, promoting meetings and debates with European-, national- and regional-level retail, industrial and farming organisations. The report included an exhaustive series of recommendations to the European Commission with a view to a fair income for farmers and a better-functioning food supply chain.

In fact, since 2008, the Commission and Parliament have been producing communications, reports and recommendations, and establishing high-level forums and groups to solve this serious problem, without anything having changed in practice beyond increased awareness. We have returned to the subject and it needs to be said without hesitation that a significant proportion of the problems that farmers are experiencing result from the highly punitive behaviour imposed, above all, by modern retailers.

The problems have been more than identified. What has been lacking in the Commission and the Member States is a genuine political will to implement solutions. Until we have that, farmers and consumers will continue to suffer harm.</literal>

  –Mr President, this is not the first time we have discussed the highly lop-sided distribution of power and margins in the food production chain. If we are honest, the European Commission has been insulting this Parliament for many years by ignoring our demands. Yes, there is a high-level group, yes, there have been reports, but there have been no concrete initiatives. I am therefore happy with the Commissioner’s minor undertaking.

However, who is it that is suffering because of that lack of action? It is the primary producer. On that score, it is rather telling that we have the Commissioner for Industry here with us. I have heard him speak about industry, about processing and about the competition between companies. However, where does the greatest unfairness in the production chain lie? Right there, in the relationship between the farmer, the primary producer, and the rest of the chain. He has not said anything about that.

And to Mr Agnew, who finds this debate so important that he has already left the room, and all his colleagues from the British Conservative Party, who put the interests of the City of London, with its warped financial products, above the producers of their daily bread, I will tell you how the market really works. When a Dutch tomato producer, during the EHEC crisis, is confronted with a price drop of more than 50% – not through any fault of his own, but just as the result of silly remarks made by a German Minister – he is happy that at least he has a contract with a supermarket for a fixed and agreed price. What happens in reality, however, is that this supermarket – which by the way is German – then returns his tomatoes because it knows that in this crisis, it can force the producer to agree to a lower price.

This, Commissioner, is the way the market works at the moment, and if you had done your job, this would not be possible in a European internal market. This House talks about fair trade with third world countries, but fair trade starts at home, with a fair price for European producers. That is your job, Commissioner.</literal>

  –Mr President, we have been talking about the imbalances in the food chain for a long time. However, the situation has remained unchanged. Farmers continue to be the victims of illegal contracts and unfair competition. In my country, food producers need to pay a duty to be able to sell their products in supermarkets, not to mention an additional shelf charge to ensure their products a high profile in stores. In addition, farmers only receive a tiny percentage of the profits which the large stores make after selling this farm produce. In the overwhelming majority of cases, good-quality products from small and medium-sized farms find it very difficult to gain access to consumers as these producers cannot cope with the competition or the conditions imposed by supermarkets. In Romania, farmers are forced to throw away a good proportion of the fruit or vegetables they produce as they cannot gain any benefit from them under current market conditions.

I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Commission and Member States to provide farmers with a stronger negotiating position in the food chain, ensure that the competition rules in agriculture are observed, and encourage local markets.</literal>

Progress is being made. Stakeholders who did not talk to each other before have agreed on the principle of good conduct. As we speak, they are sitting down and talking about implementing measures. That is not enough. We want more and we are putting pressure on them. However, just as the Commission is telling us that the process framed in the High-Level Forum for a Better Functioning Food Supply Chain would not work, they are ready to present legislation.

What is the point of this House voting today to ask to propose robust legislation? We are just running the risk of derailing our own process and undermining our own credibility. We are running the risk that the stakeholders whom we are asking to trust each other will say that, since the Parliament does not trust them, how can they be credible? Parliament has decided that the retail round table is the forum where progress will be assessed, based on data and facts. This will happen at the end of this year.

Over the last decade, European farmers have seen an intolerable increase in production costs, which is not adequately reflected in sales prices. European agricultural production still depends, to a large extent, on oil. Over the last decade, the price of oil has risen by 60%.

In order to address this challenge, the new CAP must increase the use of renewable energy by implementing self-sufficient energy production in farms, using agricultural waste and so forth to feed biomass and biogas plant. This will give us sustainable agriculture and a reduction in costs.</literal>

The supply of food to the European market has serious deficiencies that affect not only farmers, but also consumers. We also see, however, that the food sector is reacting to it. The affected parties, from farms to traders, are in a dialogue with the objective of defining unfair business practices. All participants assert that it is wrong and unfair to demand instruments such as standard contracts, payment and supply conditions and even payments for listing a product. They become unfair when they are used to abuse their market position. The self-regulation process is a dialogue between all stakeholders. For it to produce a result, we need a certain amount of time.

We cannot afford to price our farmers out of the market. Any such reduction in agricultural holdings would simply increase our dependency on external markets. This would be negative for Europe both in terms of the value of agriculture to the EU and in terms of the quality and safety of the food available to consumers.

The agri-food industry and distribution represent 7% of total employment within the EU, and are worth EUR 1 200 billion per year – more than any other manufacturing sector in the EU. There is the further problem that food produced in third countries may not be of the same quality, and may not adhere to the same standards and rigorous health and safety provisions, as food which is produced within the EU. Given the importance of the agri-food industry to Europe, it is therefore vital that we protect farmers and thoroughly examine the issue of increasing farm output prices.</literal>

Of course, it is good that the matter is discussed, but I do hope that we will now really be able to get to grips with this problem, perhaps in connection with the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP).

It is clear that in many countries of the European Union, trade is very centralised and that has contributed to the disparities in farmers’ income formation and also put them in a bad light in these price negotiations. We must strengthen the position of farmers in talks, but also ensure that they enjoy a more stable income arrangement as a result.

Mr Bové’s report was also excellent. It is also evident that inputs have risen dramatically, and it should be possible for this to be reflected in prices. I hope that we will be able to address this issue in the context of the CAP reform.</literal>

Mr Bové was quite right to encourage farmers to cultivate their own seeds rather than relying on seed monopolies, and also to recycle phosphates and nitrogen rather than relying on ever more expensive purchases, and, of course, to return to the production of traditional products. He has also shown himself to be aware of the burden of the cost of complying with legislation – much of it, of course, EU legislation. He might have mentioned the costs of the new enriched poultry cages that have to be borne by countries complying with this very welcome legislation but not, of course, by those countries that have studiously ignored it.

Certainly, the monopolies have to be tackled. Mr Smith and others have outlined instances of extraordinary monopolies that definitely must be tackled. Secondly, there are opportunities with energy efficiency and other measures whereby farmers can help themselves, but as Mr Stevenson pointed out, they have to be practical and not by people who are selling products that will not make much difference in the long term.

  –Mr President, my colleague was right: we need fair conditions between the market participants. It is precisely those fair conditions that we do not have. On the other hand, we do have a social market economy. In other words, politicians are obliged, where there is a will so to do, to intervene and regulate.

To do so, however, we would need a form of language that the market would understand. Poor prices for farmers must mean, quite simply, that we offer less in return. Then we have the problem of imbalance. Agriculture is made up of small actors – many operators – while the processing industry consists of medium-sized enterprises and the retail sector is highly concentrated. Put simply, things cannot work like that.

What we definitely need, in my view, is strong interest groups and trade associations for agriculture that could regulate the market. In addition, farmers need interest groups and market information. They must also be allowed to reach price agreements. Anti-trust law thus also needs to be amended in favour of our agricultural industry.</literal>

  –Mr President, agriculture is, and will remain, a strategic sector in the European Union’s economy. In order to tackle future challenges and ensure a degree of consistency with interventions carried out in a particular region, we must first of all establish close links between agricultural policy, rural development policy and regional policy. With regard to the uneven response by food prices to the fluctuations in commodity prices, I think that this is mainly linked to the number of intermediaries operating throughout the supply chain.

I am therefore in favour of adopting instruments which will be used to promote and support short supply chains and markets where farmers can sell their own produce directly. This will help establish a direct link between consumers and farmers in a particular region, enabling the latter to obtain a greater share of the value of the final price, while the general public will benefit from lower prices.</literal>

               –Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Tajani will have noticed that when it comes to agriculture, the European Parliament speaks with one voice. I believe that that is very important.

The fact that today, alongside my report on inputs, my colleagues wanted to raise once again, in a resolution, the issue of the food chain and the fact that farmers are not taken into account and still suffer at the hands of the processing and distribution industries, at a time when we are discussing inputs, shows that since September 2010, when we adopted the report on the food chain, things have not progressed quickly enough. This is indeed a fundamental issue that we are examining today, and that fundamental issue is that farmers are being strangled – as I said earlier – between the upstream and downstream parts of the chain.

Today, farmers have less and less autonomy when making choices – production choices, choices concerning their farming model – because they are completely stuck. What we now want to see is farmers being returned to the heart of the European agricultural policy, through the CAP, but also through very clear rules regarding the economic aspects, protection for farmers in relation to the distribution sector and their capacity to negotiate with the processing industry. I believe that such an agreement is crucial.

Today, you will have seen that we have spoken with a single voice, regardless of our political group. Today, as far as we are concerned, agriculture is a priority. It is the EU’s largest integrated policy, as I said before. It is essential to ensure that, when resolving the crises, support for farmers is at the forefront of our mind, because when we talk about agriculture, we are talking about how to feed 500 million Europeans. If we cannot feed our fellow citizens, Europe will cease to make sense.</literal>

               Agriculture is facing an ever more complex situation. While the purchase costs of agricultural inputs such as energy, machinery, feed mixtures, fertilisers, pesticides, seed or water are rising sharply, farmers’ profits are stagnating. Agricultural activities consume large amounts of energy. Farmers are trying to maximise energy savings by insulating agricultural buildings, using alternative energy sources and so on. In view of the strategic position of agriculture for Europe, producing safe food and providing independent sustenance for the European population, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council to consider the options for setting maximum energy prices for primary agricultural production. The second financially burdensome input factor is the cost of fertilisers and soil improvers. There is room for improvement here on the part of farmers. Farmers have become accustomed to using large quantities of fertilisers. Restricting the massive use of chemicals will benefit soil ecosystems and help natural renewal. I would therefore like to urge greater use of natural fertilisers and the natural products that already exist in agriculture as by-products. I would also like to emphasise support for organic farming. The third fundamental problem for farmers is the rapidly rising cost of seed and planting stock. This worrying situation is caused by the massive purchasing of certified seed and the modest use of farm-saved seed. At the same time, farm-saved seed is economically advantageous and benefits the environment. I would like to call for the revision of all regulations restricting farmers in the use of their own seed.</literal>

               – The widening gap between input and production costs and farm gate prices is not economically viable; for the younger generation, farming is not a viable option. Only 7% of Irish farmers are under 35 years old. We now have a world population of 7 billion; by 2027, it is projected that the world population will reach 8 billion and by 2046, 9 billion! This means that a decreasing number of farmers will have to double food production, while also battling climate change and maintaining food standards. The total input costs for EU farmers climbed by 40% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices have increased by only 25%. Farmers are living on their overdrafts or savings and that cannot continue. We need to ensure that farming is a real career choice for our young people.</literal>

               –Ever increasing production and agricultural input costs in conjunction with only marginally increasing farm gate prices have resulted in a drop in income for farmers. Statistics explicitly point to the increase in the prices of animal feed, seeds, fertilisers and plant protection products. At this point, I would like to emphasise the significance of energy. According to Eurostat, the price of energy, including electricity, gas and fuel, has increased by approximately 60% over the last 10 years. The construction of biogas plants and infrastructure that use wind, solar and geothermal energy undoubtedly involves significant expense. However, in the long term, this expense is certainly beneficial, as it increases income and has a positive impact on environmental protection.

Practices aimed at saving energy and increasing energy efficiency must be encouraged and implemented in all holdings at local levels, either individually or through cooperation between neighbouring farmers. Moreover, engaging in cooperation aimed at better resource management and good farming practices will increase the bargaining power and market stability of farmers, which will, in turn, translate directly into higher incomes. Collaboration with research centres, reduction in protein deficit, systems for monitoring land prices and access to land are, of course, the remaining challenges, which must be tackled by the future common agricultural policy.</literal>

Add to this the increase in operating costs for farms, which average 3.6% per year. The imbalance is aggravated further by the speculation on agricultural commodities. This situation, which affects both farmers and consumers, cannot continue. We must protect both producers and consumers by ensuring that the large-scale distribution sector does not take the lion’s share.

               –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, space has now become a pressing topic. This is demonstrated by the acute media interest in the launch of the first two Galileo satellites, which were launched on 21 October 2011 from the European base of Kourou, representing the first step in achieving European Union independence in satellite navigation.

The achievement of this ambitious goal is, in large part, due to the impetus provided by Article 189 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which clearly and unequivocally gives the European Union responsibility for coordinating and consolidating national space policies and programmes through a joint approach in order to promote scientific and technical progress and industrial competitiveness.

This aim, laid down by the Treaty, recognises the importance of space and the services it generates for EU citizens in social, economic and strategic spheres, considering it essential to enable the European Union to compete on the world stage with its competitors. The treaty therefore provides an authoritative basis designed to achieve ambitious goals. The European institutions must allocate suitable resources and legislative instruments to do so.

On this point, I have had the honour of working over recent months within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on drawing up the draft report on a space strategy for the European Union that benefits its citizens. I hope that the final version of the text will accurately reflect the ambitious proposals that we have tried to include in the report.

I refer, above all, to the different way in which the two strategic programmes in European space policy, Galileo and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), have been treated. While firmly endorsing the emphasis that the Commission has thus far placed on Galileo, one of the pillars of European space policy, I believe that, in light of the investments made so far, amounting to as much as EUR 3.5 billion, and the strategic importance of the programme, GMES deserves equal treatment in both economic and strategic terms.

I am convinced that only by developing both programmes in synergy will it be possible to ensure that our continent achieves technological and political independence, providing huge economic and social benefits to European citizens. That is why, in the report approved by the Committee on Industry, which we are to vote on shortly, I expressed my deep regret about the Commission’s decision not to include funding for GMES in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020, in the knowledge that the lack of a financing plan providing economic support could mean that the significant investment made to date has been fruitless.

Another important aspect to clarify is the strategy that the Commission decides to adopt on the management aspects of the Galileo and GMES programmes with a view to streamlining the organisational structure and having a precise framework for maintenance costs.

We have also attempted to highlight, in the report, the need for Europe to ensure that it is independent with regard to access to space, and for commercial agreements concluded with third countries to be based on completely reciprocal relations, avoiding dependence on suppliers outside Europe in relation to certain key technologies such as launchers. The latter, together with the creation of a European space situational awareness system and the strengthening of research, are key elements in an ambitious text which we hope will give the answers that European citizens are waiting for.

In order to be far-sighted, European space policy cannot ignore support for industry. At a time like the present, when there is a deep economic crisis, it seems more vital than ever for the EU to provide economic support to the space industry with a view to maintaining our continent’s competitiveness within an increasingly competitive global system.

Only if we provide European industry with real, tangible prospects will we be able to demand that industry invest in human resources and complex long-term technologies. Only if European industry maintains its leadership in space know-how will our continent be able to remain a leader in this crucial sector.

As rapporteur on European space policy, this is direction that I have attempted to take. I hope that a convincing vote by Parliament will give force to a text which, in line with Article 189 of the new Treaty, provides for scientific and technological development in a sector whose sustainable growth is essential for the EU.</literal>

In view of the fact that services in the area of space are growing rapidly and that the Galileo system provides certain advantages compared to competing systems, it may be expected that it will bring corresponding social and economic benefits in the near future.

The Commission is quite right to point out that great enterprises bring in their wake consequential benefits: new products, new knowledge, riches and inspiration for innovation, as well as a few detriments, of course. However, the real motivation is to confer authority and legitimacy on a political entity that might otherwise falter.

In the words of the Commission, ‘space serves to cement the EU’s position as a major player on the international stage and contributes to the Union’s economic and political independence’. For the EU’s independence, read our slavery.</literal>

               –The purpose of European space policy is to improve the daily lives of the European public, foster potential for innovation, support scientific progress and create qualified jobs. That is why it plays an important role in the Europe 2020 strategy. It is currently facing challenges: implementing the flagship policies, cooperating and competing internationally, and boosting the present economic importance of services provided in the field of radionavigation. To this end, it is important to make full use of the potential of EU territory and of investments already made.

As such, I should like to stress the usefulness of the satellite station on Santa Maria Island in the Azores, whose activities relate to monitoring the oceans and space missions, like Galileo. The EU should be aware of the Azores’ location in the middle of the Atlantic and how this can be best exploited, in particular, by giving them new importance. I would also highlight the usefulness of creating space clusters. These not only contribute to the EU objectives that I have mentioned, but also to promotion of the local economy through the recruitment of highly qualified personnel, or through the necessary partnerships with local business, as has been happening in the Azores. This is another opportunity for stimulating indicators of convergence with the EU, particularly in the outermost regions.</literal>

               The European Space Programme, with the Galileo satellite navigation project at its head, has achieved some remarkable successes in the past year. The same applies to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme, which monitors climate change and security threats. Among the most significant successes are, above all, sending two satellites into space as part of the Galileo programme. At the same time, it is far from being just an expensive scientific whim. Both projects are of practical use in a range of areas, such as agriculture, transport, environmental protection and, of course, national security. What is more, the services linked to these programmes have enormous economic potential and create new jobs. The European space industry alone had a turnover of EUR 5.4 billion last year, employing 31 000 workers. The space programme, however, just like other research programmes, is threatened with budget cuts. In restricting these projects, the EU would surrender many opportunities for economic growth, particularly in the future, and I would therefore like to support adequate funding of the space programme in the multiannual financial framework.</literal>

               –The European space strategy must serve both the economy and basic research. That is why it is crucially important that, in addition to the grand implementation of flagship projects such as Galileo, we invest adequately in basic research as, beyond dispute, it is a major investment in the future.

From the point of view of Europe’s values and prestige, it is not appropriate to become a freeloader with regard to science. Space research is the privilege to discover the universe that mankind inhabits, and one that might even be regarded as his responsibility and, here, Europe must set an example. Obviously, however, the money invested in research must correlate with the added value that research brings to science. This being the case, the cost-effectiveness of projects should be borne in mind, in addition to which there needs to be agreement with other noteworthy agencies and actors on international collaboration and division of labour.

The importance, in terms of security policy, of an independent navigation satellite system cannot be exaggerated. It is vitally important for the border guard, the military, crisis management troops and disaster relief personnel to be in possession of the details of their position, regardless of the global policy situation. However, GPS cooperation with NATO and, in particular, the United States must continue in a positive spirit, with the options for a partial coordination of systems being kept open. Europe is excellently qualified for space research, having educated people, a launching site close to the equator, and a strong values base. It only lacks, as in many other respects, the courage and drive to hold the position it deserves in the global context.</literal>

  ,–Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their cooperation during the drafting of this report.

This fruitful collaboration meant that we were able, swiftly and almost unanimously, to approve a text on an issue, that of the waste of food, which has, for too long, been underestimated by the institutions and by policy. We can no longer permit ourselves to underestimate it.

All the most authoritative specialist sources now say that one of the main problems in the immediate future will be to tackle the new and extremely high demand for food and that therefore, the issue of food security has become one of the most difficult problems to tackle because, in the future, the demand for food will tend to exceed supply. If this is true, we can no longer allow ourselves to remain passive in the face of food waste. When we talk of food, we are talking of food that is still perfectly edible, and so this issue has become a large-scale problem which is no longer sustainable.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that a third of food produced every year in the world that is intended for human consumption is wasted, and in Europe, the figure is already 50%, with every citizen on average wasting 105 kilograms per year. We have reached such a level, in fact, that we have to say that we are faced not only with an ethical problem, but with a real economic and social issue, with enormous implications for the environment.

That is why, through this report, we want combating food waste to become a priority on the European Union’s policy agenda. We are therefore asking for the Commission to lead the 27 Member States in adopting a common strategy that can foster a real step change to reduce food waste significantly by 2025.

We therefore ask that all the associations, volunteer groups and initiative-taking centres that have produced specific projects in this area in various countries should be turned to good account. These experiences have generated a virtuous system which has guaranteed significant recovery of products to be sent to those sections of the population that are experiencing financial difficulties.

I would like to remind you that in Europe, wealthy Europe, nearly 70 million citizens live under the poverty threshold and suffer from malnutrition. We are therefore asking for precise directives from the Commission.

Specifically, it would be important to amend the regulations on public procurement for catering services in canteens and hospitals so that, when they are being considered, priority is given, other terms being equal, to those enterprises that have a management model established on combating food waste. On this aspect, I would like to point out that the important fact is that the first to set an example should be the European institutions, starting with this Parliament.

Finally, we are calling for all stakeholders in the agri-food industry to take responsibility. A real awareness-raising campaign needs to be conducted, targeted firstly at the large farmers’ organisations, the world of industry, schools and universities, which can produce a civil and scientific culture oriented towards a more restrained and environmentally sustainable model of consumption.

With this report, the European Parliament has done its part. Now we hope that the Commission will address this work by putting an effective strategy in train. Above all, we hope that swift action will be taken to declare 2014 the European Year against Food Waste; this would be a tangible sign of the institution’s true, strong and immediate commitment in this area.

This would give an immediate signal to all citizens that the European Union is able to be at the forefront in establishing a fairer and balanced development model.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot allow food waste to increase any more, and we must combat it with special instruments, as well as through a culture designed to illustrate its economic, environmental and social effects.

In the last 30 years, food waste has grown by 50%, with consequences that are not only ethical but also economic, environmental, social, nutritional and health-related. It does not seem ethically sustainable that, in the face of the 70 million people, approximately, living in Europe under the poverty threshold, tonnes of food which is still edible are being thrown into the rubbish bin, or that the materials used for the production and packaging of this food are not being sorted as much as possible.

This waste, therefore, entails high economic and social costs. The proposals by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development cover spheres which, from packaging to more detailed information on the expiry date, are aimed at helping citizens to avoid waste and to reuse products.</literal>

  –Mr President, annual food waste generation in the 27 Member States is estimated at roughly 179 kilograms per capita. However, 79 million people in the European Union live below the poverty line, and 16 million of them have received food aid from charitable institutions.

Food security is a basic human right that is achieved through the availability, accessibility and temporal stability of healthy, sufficient, adequate and nutritious food. The issue of food waste should be addressed from the standpoint of resource efficiency. We call on the Commission to launch specific initiatives targeting food waste under the Resource-Efficient Europe initiative in order to ensure that the same attention is focused on this and that awareness is also raised about energy efficiency, since both are equally important for the environment and …</literal>

  –Mr President, food wastage is a very important problem and it is a good thing that the European Parliament is dealing with this issue, especially in the context of dramatic forecasts relating to food availability in the coming decades, and the enormous increase in demand for food. The wastage problem is closely related to what we have been discussing about an hour ago, namely, the trade concentration; the fact that the greater part of the food product trade is being taken over by large retail chains. This obviously results in increased food wastage, if only for the fact that, as a rule, more food is purchased in a supermarket than in a small local shop. Therefore, this matter is particularly important. While considering food wastage, we should not forget about land wastage. The food crisis also stems from the fact that ever increasing amounts of land are being excluded from agricultural production. This is a very dangerous process.</literal>

Continuing the present rate of waste in the agricultural food chain is not only unsustainable in the long term and irresponsible towards the poorest sections of the population, but also has negative effects on the environment and causes large losses for business and the economy. The rationalisation of production, storage, processing and subsequent distribution and consumption, in which the EU annually loses up to 50% of healthy, usable and edible food, therefore requires a comprehensive European strategy to be drawn up.

  – Mr President, the world population reached seven billion last year and it is expected to reach more than nine billion by 2050. Because of this, it is vital that we consider the issue of food security and of ensuring that we can produce enough food to feed our growing populations. In focusing on producing enough food for people, we must also look at how we use the food we produce and, to that end, we must also focus on food waste.

Food waste happens at all points of the food chain – at the level of production, at the point of sale and at the point of consumption. However, the points at which food waste typically occurs differ depending on the country. In industrialised countries, most waste is concentrated at the final stages, in distribution and consumption.

In Ireland, it is estimated that up to a third of the food we buy ends up in the bin, potentially costing families more than EUR 1 000 per year. The website stopfoodwaste.ie was set up under the National Waste Prevention Programme to educate people about the issue and to promote awareness of measures to prevent food waste.</literal>

  –Mr President, saving food also means saving water, energy and labour costs. Last but not least, it is a good solution to the problem of the lack of land, which has been much discussed of late.

We should not forget that Europe is much more dependent on land beyond its borders for its food than any other region in the world, using 640 million hectares every year, which is equivalent to one and a half times the area of its own land. Almost 60% of the land used to meet Europe’s needs is actually located in other parts of the world, with an area 10 times bigger than Germany’s, for instance. This again raises the question about what we should do: do we use more land, look for more land elsewhere or use the available resources as efficiently as possible?</literal>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for opening this topic on the floor of Parliament. Some of the blame for the current situation must be borne by legislation. The obligation of producers to state a best before date and expiry date results in 18% of food ending up as waste simply because people do not consider it to be safe. In some countries, the law does not permit the prices of products to be reduced below cost price, even on their expiry date. This must change. It is a pity that the report does not mention food banks. These non-profit organisations try to replace the wastage of food with its distribution to those who need it the most. We throw food into the bin while the European Union pays for food aid. Let us support the food banks instead.</literal>

All of us can do something about this in our kitchens, our homes and when we buy food.

Our role is to highlight the debate, raise awareness and disseminate accurate information. The Commission must provide clarification with regard to date labelling. The ‘best before’ date relates to quality, not safety. More labelling would instead confuse consumers. Lower temperatures in the supply chain for refrigerated foods would also increase durability. I have also been a driving force when it comes to getting the industry to take its share of the responsibility to a greater extent. They meet millions of people every day.

We need to return to the farming culture that entails us using our common sense, being careful with our food and reusing leftovers. Instead, we currently live in a plastic culture. I hope that together, we will be able to change that. That is a challenge.</literal>

               – This report identifies the negative impact that food wastage has on the general population and, in particular, on people living near or below the poverty line. Food wastage occurs at each of the different stages of the food chain – most notably at the final stages of distribution and consumption. A change in practice, management and conduct at the various stages could both make industry more responsible and citizens more aware of this significant problem. We need a long-term action plan which will improve the entire supply chain and will focus on the ethical, economic, environmental, social, nutritional and health implications of food wastage in Europe and worldwide. Action needs to be taken at both national and European level to develop policies which will reduce waste while also improving food production practices in developing countries. The EU needs to address this salient issue in a spirit of cooperation, coordination and through the exchange of policy expertise to enable Europe to use food sustainably – from the moment of production to that of consumption.</literal>

               Food wastage, the poor health of the population and unused intellectual potential are only some of the manifestations of the current crisis. As far as food is concerned, humanity is now capable of producing enough food by non-traditional methods, from hydroponics to methods which do not resemble traditional animal and plant production at all. On the other hand, there are several billion people worldwide who make a living in the same way that countless past generations of their ancestors did, through primitive agriculture, with many of them routinely living on the brink of starvation. The world is full of irrational approaches, including the predominance of neoliberal economic schemes promoted by the most powerful countries in the world, but, at the same time, the world has a major problem with maintaining and improving the state of rural areas. The liquidation of food surpluses on the one hand, the effort towards at least slightly socially desirable steps, such as the programmes on consumption of fruit and milk products in schools, and, on the other hand, the possibility of making use – albeit not very rational use – of some types of plants for producing energy inputs shows that even a society as advanced as the EU has no recipe for solving these serious issues at present. Perhaps only a radical systemic change to the economic system across a major part of the world would bring a real solution. As this is not a realistic demand, we will at least support the declaration of 2013 as the European Year against Food Waste.</literal>

               –The world population is growing, resources are limited, and the poorest groups have inadequate access to food. On the other hand, perfectly usable food is being discarded all over the world: from losses during harvesting or storage, via transportation under conditions that are not particularly safe and errors during packaging, to the bad habits of consumers in the purchase and use of food products.

In the last 40 years, global food waste has increased by 50%.

The production of food that we do not eat results in high costs from energy and natural resources, especially water, and greenhouse gas emissions. The approximately 89 million tonnes of food thrown away in Europe produces 170 million tonnes of COper year. Apart from the environmental damage caused by food production, the costs of processing and disposing of the waste should be taken into account.

Combating food waste must become a priority on Europe’s policy agenda. The Commission, Council and Member States must adopt specific measures aimed at halving the wastage of food by 2025.

We must inform citizens not only of the causes and effects of waste, but also about ways of reducing it.</literal>

               –A study commissioned by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) reveals that 1.3 billion tonnes of food for human consumption are wasted every year.

The study also shows that industrialised countries and developing countries waste approximately the same amount of food, 670 and 630 million tonnes respectively. Every year, consumers in rich countries waste almost as much food (222 million tonnes) as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tonnes). Fruits and vegetables have the highest wastage rates.

The amount of food lost or wasted every year is equivalent to more than half of the world’s annual cereals crop (2.3 billion tonnes in 2009/2010). Education in schools and political initiatives are possible starting points for changing this behaviour, and could go so far as to also promote, together with other policies, the fight against metabolic diseases based on food.

What is needed is a collective realisation that reduces the commercial value of the appearance and quantity of food, bringing it closer to the real needs of each consumer. This is a difficult challenge, but the European Union can manage it, as it has succeeded in the past with policies with a very strong social impact, such as the ban on smoking in public places.</literal>

               –I am delighted that we in the EU are at last focusing more attention on a crucial area of food policy, which is to say, food wastage. The report before us summarises well the main problems relating to the issue. This is not just an ethical challenge: food wastage has obvious links to reforms in the agricultural sector, social justice and the issue of hunger. It goes without saying that it is a totally absurd situation where 30-50% of food, depending on the estimate, ends up as waste. Moreover, more and more often, it is waste that is not used in any way.

The proposal in the report now before us that we should halve food waste by 2025 is extremely important, and I give it my full support. However, while we are pondering ways to reduce both waste at different stages of production and consumer waste, we must bear in mind the bigger picture. Agricultural policy is food policy. When this report is adopted, I hope that together we can start to think about how we will judge overall what sort of food policy we are promoting, and what sort of follow-up mechanisms to employ. Cutting food waste will be central to this task. The report’s proposal that 2013 should be declared the European Year against Food Waste would provide us with an excellent opportunity to engage with a more sustainable food policy.</literal>

               –According to the Stockholm International Water Institute, almost half of the global harvest is lost ‘between the field and the fork’. The setting of concrete targets and the mandatory collection of food waste in households and catering outlets is, in my opinion, key to ending this waste. This requires the collection of sufficient data on the amount of waste produced in individual Member States, so that an effective statistical comparison can then be drawn. The Commission must not delay with new legislative proposals and must start collecting the necessary data as quickly as possible. Up to 50% of edible and safe food is thrown out in European households, supermarkets and restaurants every year, while 79 million EU citizens live below the poverty line and 16 million are dependent on food aid from charities. According to studies published by the Commission, food waste will increase by 40% by 2020, unless effective steps are taken. The fact that we fail to consume more than one third of the food we cultivate is a problem not just from an ethical perspective, but also from an environmental perspective. Every tonne of food waste represents the equivalent of 4.5 tonnes of CO, the unnecessary consumption of water and energy, and the unnecessary use of agricultural land. If we planted trees everywhere where the crops that are never consumed are now cultivated, we would theoretically remove 100% of greenhouse emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.</literal>

               –Food wastage has reached such high levels that it may soon be recognised as a worldwide problem. Since the 1970s, it has increased by over 50% globally. Food is being wasted everywhere: from harvest time in the fields, throughout the processing industry and, finally and most significantly, in consumers’ homes. Europe and North America are the undisputed front-runners in this shameful competition. Annually, the inhabitants of these two continents waste up to 115 kilograms of food per capita. Within the European Union itself, this indicator is even higher. According to the European Commission’s statistical data, Europeans throw out 179 kilograms of food per capita, which annually amounts to approximately 89 million tonnes of permanently wasted food.

Contrary to popular belief, it is not overproduction that is the main cause of food wastage and – in the longer term – of hunger, but inadequate stock management and inappropriate marketing strategies aimed exclusively at maximising profit. It would appear however, that the factor that contributes most to the increase in waste is the placement of only one expiry date on labels, namely, the ‘best before’ date. Producers should be encouraged to place two pieces of information on labels. In other words, they should add a ‘use by’ date. The term ‘best before’ refers to the quality of the product, while the term ‘use by’ refers to its safety. This will help consumers make informed choices and, most importantly, prevent them from discarding food which is still edible.</literal>

We need to raise public awareness though European and national campaigns and, more specifically, teach children about this issue in schools. A double expiry date, with separate ‘sell by’ and ‘use by’ dates, would, for example, prevent food from being wasted. Use of this double label must, however, be accompanied by information for the customers, who must understand what it means. In my opinion, the European Union should promote a spirit of solidarity in the catering and large-scale distribution sectors to encourage them to redistribute free of charge to food banks or disadvantaged persons any unsold food that is still edible.

We have seen the downgrading not only of our sovereign countries that make up the eurozone, but of the fund that is supposed to pay for all the bail-outs – and the reaction in this Chamber, as in the palaces and chanceries of Europe, is to try to turn off the volume, to stick fingers in ears, and to pretend that if the ratings agencies do not report what is happening, then there is not really a problem. We had Mr Brok claiming, in an interview in, that it was all a wicked Anglo-Saxon plot against the euro, that the ratings agencies are not interested in making money, and that they are trying to drive the euro to destruction.

My friends, there is no alternative to tackling the underlying problem. You cannot improve the weather by turning down the weather forecast.

It also took us a long time to adopt it by means of various referendums, whereas now, instead of implementing the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, thanks to decisions taken by certain governments, mainly the governments of France and Germany, we are beginning to pull out of many provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. At a time of crisis therefore, the Union is now moving back by a few years and a few kilometres. This is very wrong; since instead of strengthening the policies and institutions of the Union, instead of cooperating, we are slowly beginning to dismantle the post-Lisbon order.

The crisis in the eurozone is continuing and it seems that most of the solutions that have been put forward so far via complicated regulations and ever more complex financial structures have not calmed the markets. An intergovernmental agreement could be faster to agree and simpler for the markets to understand if it were necessary, but as the most important aspects of this treaty are already included in a ‘six-pack’ on economic governance, I do not see any value in Parliament wasting its time on this rehashed agreement.

If it takes an intergovernmental treaty for Member States to live up to these commitments already in secondary EU legislation, then why are we wasting time legislating in this House?

They are often delivered in a rather disparaging tone, but I take them as a constructive basis for negotiation.

It seems that if we are not going to be part of this new Treaty on Fiscal Union, this new FU Treaty, then it is logical that this should become the main forum for further integration. It should be, for example, the forum in which any tax harmonisation happens. It should indeed be not only the unit of economic governance, but of wider political amalgamation.

This would leave Britain in, if you like, an outward shell of the EU which would have been drained of its substance, as the weasel was said to suck the contents out of an egg while leaving the shell untouched. It would still be called the European Union, but it would, in practice, have subsided into a free trade area bolstered by a little bit of intergovernmental cooperation.

The past twenty years or so has seen an increasingly widespread ownership and proliferation of personal household and electrical equipment by our citizens, and technology continues to develop at a rapid rate to satisfy increasing demands for cutting-edge products. As a result, electrical hardware often becomes obsolete after a comparatively short shelf-life and needs discarding.

This report makes out that only a third of such hardware is disposed of in the prescribed manner and recycled. This disposal figure needs to increase and Parliament must continue to support the Commission’s 2020 target of 65%, with an interim target of 45%. I particularly welcome the proposal for retailers to provide collection points for redundant small portable equipment – objects such as our mobile phones. The effect of the poisonous pollutants emanating from the avoidable, incorrect disposal of electronic goods does not respect national boundaries.

I would like to emphasise the importance of the measures for raising the awareness of and informing the public. This will ensure the success of the waste management schemes.

For example, the Romanian authorities have created a website offering complete information about collecting and recycling electrical and electronic equipment. Another measure was the launch of the national ‘Marea debarasare’ (Big Disposal) campaign in 2007. As a result of this annual event, several thousand tonnes of waste have been collected.</literal>

  –Mr President, waste electrical equipment is one of the fastest growing waste products in the European Union. We must do everything in our power to ensure that it is recycled professionally in order to be able to mitigate our loss of resources. In the interest of preventing environmental and health damage, we must seek to ensure appropriate collection. Impact assessments reveal that although 85% of these waste products are now collected in EU Member States, only 33% of them undergo appropriate processing. By preserving existing and tested systems, all actors involved in collection and treatment must engage in conduct that complies with the directive.

Experience so far has unfortunately shown that Member States differ in their interpretations of the present directive. We must strive to ensure that the new Member States, too, are able to catch up and follow the provisions of the directive. This also includes selective waste collection. Selective collection could also serve to reduce the extensive illegal transport of waste outside the EU. I believe that costs incurred during collection and treatment should be incorporated into product prices so as to serve as an incentive to reduce costs. I, too, voted in favour of this proposal.</literal>

  – Mr President, this report on waste electrical and electronic equipment seems to strike the right balance in terms of what should be decided at EU level and what should be left to Member States. For Wales, a key element will be the way in which the collection target will be calculated – the current method being kept until the end of 2013, after which there will be an interim target and then an ambitious target of 65% of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) placed on the market from 2020.

Member States such as my own will now have the choice of opting for a more ambitious 85% target should they wish to do so. Conversely, I welcome the proposal that the Commission will assist those Member States who are struggling to meet the targets, with transitional adjustments. While it is important to increase the amount of EEE being recycled and to reduce the waste, it is equally important that the approach should not be too prescriptive but should give Member States the flexibility to choose the most appropriate and achievable target for them. Delivering a positive result will now be up to the Member States: it will be up to them to demonstrate commitment turned into reality.</literal>

Mr Florenz, who has now departed – thankfully not this life but the Chamber – has done good work and it has been recognised by all the speakers in the House.

This is certainly a huge area for us.

In addition, with the retention of the two-step Biocidal Products Directive, the procedure particularly of assessing chemical active ingredients and the approval system that differentiates between the so-called ‘normal’ and ‘problematic’ substances will still remain in force. This is essential for the legislation to be effective.

I believe the labelling requirements introduced by the compromise package for those materials treated with biocides and the simplification of data protection rules to be positive steps. The mandatory data sharing mechanism is also important and has been put forward in the report.

The result of that is that foreign manufacturers, too, will have to meet high European standards if they want to sell their products in Europe. From the point of view of the agricultural sector, however, it is important that biocides continue to be available for use by our farmers.

A good compromise has been achieved here, and it is one that facilitates the sustainable use of biocides and further reduces potential risks when they are used.

This report balances usage requirements whilst upholding a high level of protection for human and animal health and the environment. It is important that the process of assessing the active ingredient and the subsequent authorisation of a biocidal product will be maintained at current standards to ensure the highest level of protection.

Coming from a background of biochemistry, I welcome that there will be a regular review of biocides, with the initial approval or subsequent renewals having a limit of 10 years. However, despite the report initially proposing a ban on all carcinogens, it is important that they will still be permitted to be used in a controlled manner particularly with regard to rodent control pesticides, which are widely used by the farming community in my region in Wales. Safe, regulated use is far preferable to an outright ban. I also support the rules for mutual recognition which will, of course, provide for a single market in biocides across the whole of the EU.</literal>

One of the key elements of the report is the proposition that greening measures in pillar one should be made optional.

  –Mr President, today’s own-initiative report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development draws attention to an important problem in agriculture. This is that, in recent years, input and production costs have risen much more quickly than farm gate prices.

We need fair conditions between all market participants. That is, of course, why we have a social market economy. A social market economy means that politicians need to get involved when these fair market conditions are not in place.

One problem that we have in the agricultural sector is that we have a large number of farms and a processing industry made up mainly of medium-sized companies, whereas the retail sector at the end of the chain is highly concentrated into the hands of a small number of operators. The result of this, of course, is that it is the farmers, as the least organised of these sectors, who most often draw the short straw. As a result, we need a great increase in the number of interest groups to obtain market information and to be able to come to agreements about prices. Current anti-trust rules do not do justice to these needs and need to be amended accordingly.</literal>

At the end of the day, we are tackling this huge problem, that of major buyers – especially multinationals – who are making extraordinary profits and farmers who are making little or no profit. This must be corrected. Bad practices must end, especially practices such as hello money, as it is called. If we succeed in correcting this, our farmers will get a fair deal. It is high time for us to do that, as, until now, the major buyers have had a clear run and that is not fair to anyone.</literal>

  – Mr President, space has always exerted a pull on the imagination of a certain kind of European integrationist. Space exploration is seen almost in Cold War terms, as a kind of virility symbol, a way of asserting Europe’s place in the world.

One thinks of President Chirac’s description of the Galileo project as a way of breaking the technological imperialism of the United States; one thinks of the obsession of successive French Presidents with putting a Frenchman– which, of course, we would all support, although I think there would need to be intergovernmental negotiations on whether to bring him back again, depending on which Frenchman it was.

My friends, space has become an almost perfect symbol of the European Union. In order to publicise the most recent European election in the UK, we had the image of a ballot box in orbit – and there, writ large, is what the European Union has become: disconnected, unworldly, looking down on the rest of us, cut off, remote.

Even as your feet sink into the mire, you, my federalist friends, are still gazing fixedly at the stars.</literal>

The combined technical expertise of all our scientists and engineers would serve to improve space technology that aids both the EU economy and improves the quality of life of our citizens. For example, the GPS satellites that millions of motorists rely on across Europe could be enhanced to give further accuracy and innovation for traffic management and secure the passage of merchant shipping, which delivers the bulk of imported goods to our European economy.

I would also support the EU’s Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme, which aims to create a capacity for earth observation and the environmental benefits we would hope that it would eventually bestow. However, I support the report’s call for the GMES to be funded through the multiannual financial framework, which is preferable to the Commission’s wish that it be funded outside of the European Union budget, placing an added financial burden on Member States during these times of increased austerity.</literal>

  – Mr President, the report on space strategy for the European Union makes sound and sensible proposals in an area where shared Member State resources can be made to go further.

Having an EU space strategy facilitates the pooling of resources and intelligence so that we can make real, innovative progress that will benefit the entire EU and beyond. This is particularly important given the increasingly competitive world we are operating in and the spin-offs that space research often delivers for everyday products for our constituents.

An EU space strategy will ensure independent access to space, which is likely to become increasingly important over time. It will also allow further development of Galileo – our satellite navigation system project – and will assist us in developing our own high-precision positioning system in Europe.

This is an area of EU added value.</literal>

  – Mr President, Lukashenko’s dictatorship in Belarus is sometimes described as the last surviving piece of Soviet apparatus in Europe, but I think that overlooks the common agricultural policy, with its central plans, with its state support of prices, with its regulation. We have rehearsed many times the case against the CAP, the terrible damage it does to developing countries, particularly in Africa, the way in which it falls disproportionately on the poorest, the inflationary effect it has on our economies through higher food prices, the distortion of incentives in the countryside, the way in which it particularly penalises countries such as mine which are net food importers.

One thing which I think deserves more study is the way in which it funnels money to a particular kind of people in all the Member States – and they are not farmers, or at least not necessarily. The payments have become disconnected from the land. A lot of public sector institutions, NGOs and generally wealthy individuals are now receiving subsidy cheques from the European Union, and that, in a sense, is the point: we have purchased – or the EU has purchased – the loyalty of a powerful and articulate caste of people in every Member State.

I would say this is the best mechanism in Europe for redistributing money from the poor to the rich, but, of course, that honour must now go to our policy of bank bail-outs.</literal>

  – Mr President, I voted along with my group, the ECR, in favour of the changes suggested by the Caronna report. In the current economic crisis, with the global population increasing at its current rate and with widespread famine in Africa a major problem, the need to reduce food wastage has never been greater. Therefore, exchanging methods of best practice is important, as is better coordination between Member States.

One of the most important matters highlighted by the report is the fact that the rules concerning below-cost selling in our supermarkets are not the same throughout the European Union. It is important to allow retailers to sell food at discounted prices as it nears its ‘sell by’ date: this practice reduces food wastage significantly in countries such as the United Kingdom, where it is permitted. In some of our Member States, believe it or not, there is a ban on below-cost selling – absurdly making this sensible practice illegal. I hope that, with better coordination between Member States, this situation will change.

Lastly, I agree with my colleague, Dan Hannan, that a radical reform of the CAP is essential for the future.</literal>

  –Mr President, I was very happy to vote in favour of this report. Ninety million tonnes of usable food is thrown away in the European Union every year. It is unforgivable that almost half of all food is disposed of as waste during production and supply. We quite simply have to think of a better way in this regard.

I call on the Commission to produce a more detailed analysis of the causes and we also need to analyse the differences by Member State in much greater detail. If it turns out that we, the consumers, bear the primary responsibility for all this waste, we will simply have to think of something when it comes to policy.

One potential area to tackle is the best before dates on foodstuffs. These are often excessively cautious, which, of course, leads to food wastage. In Poland, instead of a best before date, packaging is printed with ‘best consumed before ...’, while in Austria, a recommended end date for consumption is printed. We should learn from those who make the most sustainable use of their foodstuffs.</literal>

This provides the basis for food security, a new fundamental right for European citizens and others.

I was very pleased that that has been the case, as, after all, we are talking here about around half of the food produced in the Member States of the European Union, which does not get to where it should, namely, to consumers to be consumed, but is instead thrown away.

I must stress to Mr Pieper once again that we really do just need to come up with more in this area. This report represents a step in the right direction, but we also need truly tangible and acceptable action to be taken.

There is one more point that I would like to highlight, and it is something that repeatedly annoys me, as a farmer. It is that we also need to close existing material cycles. In future, as in the past, we will continue to have foodstuffs that are no longer suitable for human consumption. At present, however, such foods must be destroyed, and cannot be used as animal feed. At this point, once again, I call on the Commission to take steps to ensure that food that is no longer fit for human consumption can at least still be used as animal feed.</literal>

  – Mr President, given the pressures that are already being put on our farmers to produce more food with fewer resources, the report on how to avoid food waste seems to strike the right tone.

With the UN estimating that the global population will reach nine billion by 2050, it is only sensible that we reduce food wastage as part of our food supply strategy. I support a coordinated strategy across the EU, with a network being established to facilitate the exchange of intelligence and best practice on how to achieve this reduction. The network should also seek to further coordinate research and development into improved technologies for the treatment of waste products, particularly in energy generation.

The report acknowledges that there is a need for industry to play its part in reducing food wastage, especially in terms of packaging, though I would also like to see more innovative approaches to the actual use of close-to-date food.

We need to ensure that a competitive market delivers our food in an economic and efficient form. However, we need to be careful not to replace market solutions with overly burdensome legislation.</literal>

In this context, I would like to welcome the Commission proposal on food wastage reduction by 2020. I hope that the report we have voted on today, which I supported, will contribute to this objective.

I agree with Commissioner Potočnik that in the recent situation, where many countries of the world have been suffering from food shortages, the food waste produced in Europe is morally, economically and environmentally irresponsible.

Above all, I think that people should be better informed, not only on the causes and effects of waste, but also on ways of reducing it.

  –Mr President, when I researched this matter, I was appalled by the figures. A lot of households throw out up to EUR 1 000 worth of food each year. That is a lot of money, and something must be done about it.

This report is very important. It points out some startling statistics – for instance, that 60% of the food that is thrown out need not be thrown out, and 20% is thrown out due to confusion over dates and product labelling. So that is the first thing we need to get right, and then we need to make consumers aware of it.

We also need to take into account the greenhouse gas emissions entailed in producing food that is not going to be used, and then to look at the other side of this question: at proper biowaste management for food that will not be required. We have a lot of work to do, but this is a basis.</literal>

While almost 80 million EU citizens are living below the poverty line, struggling each day to make a living, and while more than 900 million people around the world are dangerously undernourished, at the same time, food waste here in Europe every year amounts to almost 180 kilograms per person. I weigh 120 kilograms.

It is a completely intolerable situation – ecologically, economically and also ethically – where perfectly edible food is ending up in the waste bin. If edible food is being thrown away, the environmental impact of its raw materials and food processing will also have been entirely in vain, nor does it make any financial sense not to make use of edible food.

Therefore, it recognises the notion of GIs as place names used to identify the origin and quality, reputation or other characteristics of products.

               I voted in favour of the agreement on protection of geographical indications (GIs) because it has specific advantages for both the EU and Georgia. On the EU side, this bilateral agreement should ensure that around 820 food GIs, 1 930 wines and 320 spirits from 23 Member States, registered by the EU, will be protected in Georgia, which is very reassuring for EU agricultural production, as its characteristics and quality are thus respected. The agreement can also be seen as a positive step for wider EU-Georgia trade relations. Indeed, the EU started negotiations with Georgia in July 2010 over a bilateral association agreement which should have a trade component, that is to say, a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA). Before entering into negotiations on a DCFTA, the European Commission expects a set of key recommendations established as part of the Eastern Partnership and endorsed by the Council to be fulfilled by Georgia in order to ensure that this Eastern partner has the legal and institutional capacity to implement a DCFTA. The agreement on GIs therefore establishes the capacity of Georgia to negotiate and conclude with the EU substantial agreements on key, trade-related issues, including technical commitments.</literal>

               –The growing number of countries with which the EU has reached an agreement on the protection of geographical indications (GIs) must be welcomed. The results of this go well beyond economic figures and reflect on the prestige and good name of the outstanding products of European agriculture and foodstuff production.

All too often, instances ofenable the international distribution of brands that fraudulently imitate the packaging of GI products, even though they do not match their characteristics. This is misleading for consumers and hurts both the profits and the image of businesses that strive every day to keep up the quality standards of protected goods. Recently, a striking case involved the exportation to the United States of fake San Marziano tomatoes.

Even faced with the evidence of this abuse, the Commission admitted it could not step in because there is no bilateral agreement in place with the US for the protection of registered trademarks; for the right to protection to be granted, we would have had to appeal under the relevant US regulations. This is a paradoxical situation, which needs to be sorted out in short order.

By voting in favour of this recommendation, we want to take the opportunity to ask that the time required to manage these agreements be cut down.</literal>

Although the 18 GIs relating to Georgian wine making fall well short of Europe’s around 3 100 GIs, with 1 930 relating to wine alone, I hope that, by protecting its GIs, this agreement will work as a stimulus to greater promotion and perception of the quality of Georgian products in foreign markets, particularly those to which it does not traditionally export. I particularly hope this will be the case for agricultural products, which play a decisive role in the subsistence economy of its villages, and exports of which to the EU have increased in the last 10 years.

I also hope that, in the context of the ENP, this agreement will inspire greater legislative integration with other countries neighbouring our Union, and not just in the area of GIs, on which this is the first agreement to be concluded.</literal>

               –In this report, Mr Moreira analyses the recommendation on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and Georgia on protection of geographical indications (GIs) of agricultural products and foodstuffs. Although Georgia only joined the World Trade Organisation in 2000, there has been a partnership and cooperation agreement between it and the EU since 1 July 1999. Following time-honoured traditions, the purpose of GIs is to identify the origin, quality and characteristics of given products, linking them to the region where they are produced, so as to guarantee their reputation. I voted for this draft recommendation because I believe that both Georgia and the EU, particularly their farmers, will benefit greatly, since they will see the characteristics of their products – cheeses, oils and fats, bread and pastry, fruit, vegetables, cereals, fresh meats and meat products, fresh fish and seafood, wines, spirits and beers – recognised and protected. I also welcome closer EU-Georgia trade relations.</literal>

               –Geographical indications (GIs) constitute an instrument intended to protect certain names that identify products with a special link to their region of origin. GIs are indications that identify a product as originating in a given territory, in which a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the product can essentially be attributed to its geographic origin. In the current international context, marked by deregulation and liberalisation of world trade, by standardisation of production methods, by intensification and homogenisation of production, by the consequent loss of modes of production and traditional products, and by reductions in all types of biodiversity, GIs constitute an instrument that can help preserve and respect the characteristics and quality of certain local and regional products. We support the establishment of GIs for various agricultural products, such as cheeses, fruit, vegetables, cereals, meats, fish and seafood, bread and pastry, and wines and spirits originating in 23 EU countries and in Georgia. However, it should be remembered that this instrument is not a panacea for tackling the damage caused by trade deregulation. What is necessary, then, is calling into question the dogma of free trade. Regrettably, the rapporteur calls – in the same report – for the door to be opened to this.</literal>

The role of the more developed countries of the Union is to promote appropriate solutions among the countries which are only starting to grow their economies. Georgia’s case is a special one due to the county’s turbulent history – including the period when it constituted part of the Soviet Union – and ongoing ethnic conflicts. Georgia is a country of rich tradition, especially in terms of its cuisine and wine. The abundance of crops, local dishes and wines is beyond compare. As honest trade partners, we should therefore help Georgians to protect their unique produce, while at the same time promoting its high quality. Georgia’s wines are worthy of particular note. During the years of Georgia’s membership of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), wine was produced on a mass scale, with an adverse effect on quality. Now is the time to support the revival of Georgian wine, so as to encourage better development of this sector of the economy.</literal>

Exports of Georgia’s products to the EU in the last ten years have not only diversified, they have increased fourfold. While the agreement aims to streamline trade between the EU and Georgia, it also allows Georgia to strengthen its export economy to regions outside its traditional trade route.

               –The agreement signed with Georgia is an important step for the recognition of the quality of our products abroad. It is tangible proof of the fact that partnership agreements can be the driving force behind the protection of geographical indications.

For these reasons, I share in the Committee on International Trade’s unanimous approval of Mr Moreira’s report. If the Commission could manage to strike more agreements like this one – perhaps with countries whose brand culture is not yet like our own – that would be of huge benefit to foreign consumers and European producers.</literal>

               –Since both parties are members of the World Trade Organisation and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, they recognise geographical indicators, both as an instrument for identifying the characteristics of products and as having intrinsic market value. As such, the EU-Georgia agreement – the first of this type concluded with a European Neighbourhood Policy partner – represents a natural step in the context of deepening relations with that country. From the EU perspective, the agreement will protect the geographical indications of around 820 foodstuffs, 1 930 wines and 320 spirits; from the Georgian side, it will protect the geographical indicators of around 18 wines. However, it should be noted that the wine market accounts for a significant proportion of Georgia’s economy. The proportion of the country’s agricultural exports going to the EU increased from 10% in 1997 to 40% in 2007. I voted in favour, in the hope that the agreement will create closer ties between the EU and Georgia.</literal>

The UNECE’s World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations is a standing working group that operates within the United Nations and concerns itself with the regulations applicable to motor vehicles.

The rapporteur is proposing that Parliament adopt the draft Council decision on the accession of the Union to Regulation No 29 of the UNECE on uniform provisions concerning the approval of vehicles with regard to the protection of the occupants of the cab of a commercial vehicle, since it will enable the application of the same standards in many countries, so cutting red tape and contributing to the ability of European industry to compete more widely and easily. That is why I voted in favour.</literal>

Type-approvals issued under the UNECE regulations will be considered as EC type-approvals, thereby avoiding duplication not only in technical requirements but also in certification and administrative procedures, to the benefit of industry and national authorities. These technical requirements will apply in many countries located notably in the EU, non-EU Western and Eastern Europe, South-East Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Japan and North America, which are contracting parties to the UNECE 1958 Agreement. Type-approval directly based on internationally agreed standards and applied in so many countries will also be adopted by other third countries, which will further improve market access and enhance EU industry’s competitiveness.</literal>

I think that the application of the measures set out in the texts will bring further improvements to road safety rules, an area in which much can still be done to reduce the high number of road accident victims. Unfortunately, despite the Member States’ efforts, many people fall victim to these terrible accidents even today. Indeed, in 2009 alone, some 35 000 people were killed and 1.5 million injured, with the latest estimates saying that this includes 16 000 children. For these reasons, the Union – which currently accedes to some 126 UNECE regulations – needs to adapt the provisions currently in force to the more recent measures set out in the UNECE regulations.</literal>

               – As a new member of the Committee on International Trade, it is fitting that my first speech in the second half of this legislature should be related to a report by this Committee. The Moreira report deals with pedestrian safety and light emitting diodes (LEDs). The introduction of LEDs for pedestrian safety is definitely a subject everyone is in agreement with. Indeed many third-world countries have introduced LEDs into their traffic control systems. It is strange that most European countries have not done the same. The only argument being put forward is that, during a time of austerity, this is not the right time for capital expenditure. I do not agree for three reasons. In the long term, this is cost effective. Firstly, LEDs are energy savers reducing the cost of energy. Secondly, if they help to reduce pedestrian injuries, they reduce the very high costs of hospitalisation and rehabilitation. Thirdly, if they help to prevent death, then the investment in that particular human (i.e. education) will not be lost. But the most important reason is that all human life is sacred and must be protected at all costs.</literal>

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) is one of these. Initially established as a regional organisation of the UN, it is now open to all countries of the world, as well as to professional organisations, NGOs and regional organisations, and today includes more than 70. The UNECE’s World Forum for Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) debates and approves the global harmonisation of these regulations, particularly for countries that produce motor vehicles. It seems clear to me that there is an economy of scale for our EU in considering these regulations/type-approvals at global level, taking into account not just the interests of producers, but also the safety of users and the general public. This is mainly because, for example, UNECE approvals are considered EU approvals, meaning that it cuts red tape, but it is also because, objectively, it raises the bar in terms of the requirements relating to the quality, safety, environmental protection, reliability, etc. of all products manufactured. As such, I applaud the work of the UNECE in general, particularly the work of the WP.29 and, specifically, this draft regulation relating to light emitting diode light sources.</literal>

The European Commission, as the EU’s representative, thinks that both draft regulations relating to pedestrian safety and LED light sources should be included in the European Union vehicle type-approval system. This means that both draft UNECE regulations become part of the European vehicle type-approval system. The aim of the standardised requirements of the draft UNECE regulation on the vehicle approval provisions regarding pedestrian safety and the vehicle approval provisions regarding LED light sources is to remove the current technical barriers in the car trade between the contracting parties to the revised 1958 Agreement (on the technical requirements for wheeled vehicles) and to ensure that these vehicles provide a high level of safety and protection.</literal>

The regulation discussed provides for the application of the UNECE regulations for the purpose of the EC vehicle type-approval on a compulsory basis. This would mean that the type-approval of motor vehicles, their trailers and systems, as well as technical components, would be applied without the necessity for further, additional type-approval. This would make it easier for European producers, for authorities in individual states, and for consumers, by avoiding the duplication of technical requirements and certification procedures. The same standards would be used in many countries, which would radically reduce bureaucratic requirements.</literal>

Therefore, to avoid any discrimination between European Union carriers, we shall replace the national designation clauses by an EU designation clause. As our rapporteur, Brian Simpson, has pointed out, ‘the objective is to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the EU Member States concerned and Indonesia’. Furthermore, while traditional bilateral agreements tend to exempt international flights from fuel taxation, this type of taxation is authorised for operations within the European Union. The aim of the agreement is therefore to expand that right of Member States of the European Union to Indonesian airlines wishing to operate intra-Union flights.</literal>

The provisions that the EU intends to replace relate to the air transport sector, where the aim is to end discriminatory practices against EU air carriers, made possible until now precisely by the nature of the preceding bilateral agreements.

Firstly, to avoid discrimination between EU air carriers, national designation clauses, referring to air carriers of the Member State that are party to the bilateral agreement, are replaced by an EU designation clause, referring to all EU carriers. This clause aims to ensure that all EU air carriers have non-discriminatory access to routes between the EU Member States concerned and Indonesia. As for safety assurance, according to the agreement, safety provisions in bilateral agreements are applicable to situations when regulatory control over an air carrier is exercised by a Member State other than the Member State that designated that air carrier. Thirdly, under this agreement, anti-competitive practices are prohibited. The aim of this agreement is therefore to apply the same rights to Indonesian airlines wishing to operate flights within the European Union as Member States have.</literal>

               –This recommendation, drafted by Mr Simpson, concerns a draft decision of the Council regarding the conclusion of the agreement between the Union and the government of the Republic of Indonesia on certain aspects of air services. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, substantially changed the powers of several European institutions, particularly Parliament, which, in the new set-up, is called on to rule on matters which were not previously under its jurisdiction, as in this case of an international agreement between the EU and the Republic of Indonesia on air services. It is noteworthy that this agreement, negotiated by the Commission, replaces certain provisions of the 19 existing bilateral air services agreements in force, concluded between EU Member States and the Republic of Indonesia. I welcome the establishment of another agreement whose purpose is to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes with Indonesia as their destination, which represents an important step in strengthening relations between the EU and the Republic of Indonesia in the aviation sector; it also covers safety and taxation of aviation fuel.</literal>

               –This draft agreement follows on from several identical agreements already concluded between the EU and other countries. As we mentioned in relation to these other agreements, in the specific context in which civil aviation currently operates, this draft agreement raises serious concerns about its scope and possible consequences. Moves to ‘avoid discrimination between EU air carriers’ with the supposed creation of a level playing field for the various European companies could contribute to facilitating monopolistic concentration within the sector, which is already under way. The reference to the primacy of free competition in Article 4 comes under this heading, seeking to reduce the Member States’ ability to defend their flag carriers, in a sector that is strategic in terms of safeguarding national interests for a number of reasons. However, it should be stressed that, in this case, the possible implications for Portugal will be comparatively less than those of previous agreements already concluded, such as those with Brazil, the United States and Canada.</literal>

The EU Court of Justice ruled in 2002 that national designation clauses in the bilateral agreements infringe EU law. They allow a third country to reject, withdraw or suspend the permissions or authorisations of an air carrier that has been designated by a Member State but that is not substantially owned and effectively controlled by that Member State or its nationals. This has been found to constitute discrimination against EU carriers established in the territory of a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States. This is contrary to Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which guarantees nationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State. There are also further issues, such as competition, where compliance with EU law should be ensured through amending or complementing existing provisions in bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries.</literal>

               –There are 19 bilateral agreements on air services in force between Member States and Indonesia. The purpose of concluding this agreement is to bring an end to these bilateral agreements and establish a single one governing relations on certain aspects of air services with Indonesia. The Union has been signing a number of agreements of this type, because the EU Court of Justice ruled in 2002 that the traditional national designation clauses included in bilateral air services agreements infringed EU law. As such, to prevent clauses that discriminate against EU airlines and the violation of Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union on freedom of establishment, this agreement establishes the principle of the EU designation for all carriers from the EU. Furthermore, the agreement standardises regulatory control over safety, the competition principle and fuel taxation. Adoption of this agreement will reduce geographical distances, and enable closer political and economic relations.</literal>

The agreement signed on 29 June 2011 replaces certain provisions included in the existing 19 bilateral agreements on air services concluded between EU Member States and Indonesia. Certain provisions in the bilateral agreements on air services between EU Member States and Indonesia contained sections which infringe European Union legislation and must be made to comply with it in order to establish a solid legal basis for air services between the European Union and Indonesia, as well as to maintain the continuity of the relevant air services. The purpose of the agreement is to grant all EU carriers the right of non-discriminatory access to the routes between the relevant Member States and Indonesia. The aim through this agreement is not for the EU to increase the total volume of air traffic between the EU and Indonesia, to upset the balance between European Union and Indonesian air carriers, or to negotiate the changes made to the provisions on traffic rights in the existing bilateral agreements on air services. The agreement contains provisions on safety, taxation of aviation fuel and banning anti-competitive practices.</literal>

               –The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), pursuant to its rules of procedure, only allows states to join it as members. However, some years ago, the Commission sought to launch negotiations for the accession of the EU, hoping for an amendment to the ICAO’s rules. Such an amendment did not take place, and the EU is still excluded from full participation. Through the memorandum now proposed by the Council, the EU is trying to get around the obstacles posed by international law, in order to join the ICAO informally and to exert its own influence within it, although it does not legally have the right to do so. In essence, this agreement seems to be a Trojan horse that will allow the Commission to get around international law, and, what is more, at the expense of the EU Member States which, by contrast, are legal and fully-fledged members of the ICAO. Despite this, they could gradually lose their ability to exercise their rights within the ICAO if this memorandum were to enter into force. There would, of course, be specific advantages that would derive from the EU’s greater involvement in the ICAO, but these advantages would be achieved by bypassing the provisions of international law, and passing over the rights legally guaranteed to the Member States.

Furthermore, the Memorandum envisages that the parties will share electronic information, data and official publications, and provide mutual access to databases, which will help strengthen relations between the two organisations.</literal>

This directive also seeks to improve the environmental performance of all operators involved in the life cycle of electrical and electronic equipment, such as producers, distributors and consumers, particularly those operators directly involved in the collection and treatment of WEEE. Different national applications of the producer responsibility principle lead to substantial disparities in the financial burden on economic operators, and having different national policies on the management of WEEE hampers the effectiveness of recycling policies.

The issues of the treatment and recycling of waste and of the obsolescence of everyday consumer products are at the heart of the problems we have to manage within our societies. The directive we are adopting today relates to waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Each European citizen is responsible for producing between 17 and 20 kg of electronic waste on average a year. The target is commensurate with the situation: the directive provides for each Member State to increase its collection of WEEE, regardless of whether or not the annual target of 4 kg per person has already been met. This directive is positive for European consumers, who will, from now on, be able to return their small appliances to retailers and businesses with no obligation to purchase a new product. This directive is a further step forward for the recycling and treatment of WEEE in Europe.

The agreement between the Council and Parliament sets very ambitious targets for Member States and, at the same time, changes the European approach to the issue of recycling. The main benefit of the draft directive is the fact that the obligation to recycle will be extended to the entire spectrum of electrical and electronic equipment, including solar panels. The directive improves the categorisation of individual pieces of equipment for collecting raw materials, in particular, introducing a new category for small IT equipment and telephone apparatus, which will lead to raw materials collected in this way being used in the production of smart mobile devices and similar equipment. The recycling of a natural resource will then be far more effective.</literal>

I should like to highlight the most important of the objectives listed in the report: specifically, that of reducing costs by eliminating all unnecessary red tape, without affecting environmental safety; that of additional efforts towards making the WEEE Directive more effective and applicable by increasing the rate of compliance and reducing free-loading; and, finally, that of reducing the impact of the collection, treatment and recovery of WEEE products on the environment, in order to maximise their net benefit for society.</literal>

               –The exponential growth in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) means that hard-hitting changes to the legislation governing its recycling and production cannot be put off.

The growth in the sector is directly proportional to the effect on the Europe 2020 objectives for a resource-efficient economy: to achieve this, national legislation is no longer sufficient; what is needed is systematic European legislation. In line with these objectives, in addition to avoiding further damage to the environment and in order to hold on to precious resources, what we need are high collection rates, appropriate recycling standards, targeted action against illegal exports and a fairer distribution of responsibilities and costs between producers, consumers and public authorities.

Parliament’s amended text seems to be in line with these requirements and, in addition, puts forward two particularly sensitive aspects that deserve attention and support. Firstly, it includes eco-design, not only with regard to energy consumption standards, but also with regard to a simplification of the procedures for dismantling or recovery of raw materials.

Equally important is the requirement for the costs incurred in the recovery and treatment of raw materials to become an integral part of the product’s price, so as to form an incentive for the purchase of products with lower impacts. I voted for this recommendation for these reasons.</literal>

This revision has been carried out for two main reasons, which are well explained in the report. Firstly, it has been revised owing to the experience gained from implementing the directive since it came into force, when some weaknesses were found in its architecture and implementation. Secondly, it has been revised because it faces a number of new challenges, since WEEE is the type of waste that has seen the most growth in the EU. The amendments agreed today will make the directive more effective, enhance its applicability and protect the environment, so I obviously voted in favour.</literal>

This has led to an increase in the tonnes of waste from these products, which are left in open-air dumps or illegally exported. Apart from the environmental problems that this causes, putting human health at risk, this situation constitutes an enormous waste of materials, including precious metals such as gold, platinum and silver, which could help global economic recovery and reduce the extraction of natural resources. This recommendation for second reading, drafted by Mr Florenz, concerns the Council position at first reading on the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on this waste. It is imperative to proceed towards the implementation of measures that encourage selective collection, recycling and/or recovery of these materials, so I voted for this report. I hope that the new directive will be applied as swiftly as possible, and that it will thereby contribute to improving public health and preventing the illegal export of waste electrical and electronic equipment to countries that do not have environmental controls.</literal>

The reality is that waste flows have been growing within the EU, and that it is therefore necessary to take measures aimed at the collection and treatment of waste, with a view to increasing recycling and reuse, especially in relation to secondary raw materials. The scope of the directive extends to all electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), unless explicitly excluded. New definitions have been added to enhance legal certainty and consistency with other EU legislation.

In terms of its targets, within four years, the Member States should achieve a collection rate of 45% of WEEE, taking account of the EEE that has been placed on the market in the last three years. The goals for recovery and combined recycling/reuse will be increased by 5% over the next three years.</literal>

Member States were required to transpose the requirements of the directive by 13 August 2004. Neither the drivers nor the rationale for collecting and recycling WEEE have changed since the adoption of the directive. Experience with the first years of implementation of the WEEE Directive has indicated technical, legal and administrative problems that result in unintentionally costly efforts from market actors and administrations, continuing environmental harm, low levels of innovation in waste collection and treatment, a lack of a level playing field or even distortion of competition, as well as unnecessary administrative burdens. The Commission is committed to developing a better regulatory environment, one that is simple, understandable, effective and enforceable. The specific objectives of the review of the WEEE Directive are therefore the following areas: reduced administrative costs without lowering the level of environmental protection; implementation of the directive through increased compliance and reduced free-riding; reduced impacts on the environment from the collection, treatment and recovery of WEEE at the levels where the greatest net benefit to society results. If the necessary measures had not been adopted, the problems and disparities in this area would continue. This was one of the reasons that the directive in question was amended accordingly.</literal>

Yet components are often found in this type of waste which are particularly dangerous to health and the environment. Current practices in our Member States need to change. It is in this context that I voted for the compromise obtained after many years of negotiations, which sets a waste recovery target of 85% in 2019. As a result, despite opposition from some companies, which complain that a heavy burden is being placed on them, it is expected that the major distributors will have to set up collection points for used telephones and small appliances to encourage consumers to recycle. A new obligation will also be established to prevent European companies from sending potentially dangerous goods outside the EU. Finally, the recycling of precious metals, such as gold, silver and rare earth metals contained in these used products, which will reduce our dependence on external sources for these materials, is another advantage.</literal>

The report was one of Parliament’s most important achievements in that electoral term, and it is good that it is now being brought up-to-date.

Thanks to legal reform, more and more electronic equipment is being repaired and recycled, something which, in the past, could not even be realised in practice. As I said during the previous WEEE debate, this is exactly how we can ensure that product design is environmentally friendly, and thus guarantee the feasibility of the whole directive. When producers know that they will eventually have to pay for the final phases of the equipment, costs are minimised beforehand, and they will ensure that as little waste as possible is generated and that this small amount is as recyclable as possible. In this way, the entire chain of producers, importers, traders, consumers, waste management operatives and recycling centres, as well as the authorities, are all accountable, just as they should be.</literal>

Around 700 000 tonnes of electrical waste was generated in 2010 in Germany alone; 155 000 tonnes of this is illegally shipped to countries such as Ghana every year. Either disposal companies that have already been paid by the device manufacturers to recycle the waste flog it off to dealers, or citizens are enticed to buy the equipment for a couple of euro from the gates of municipal recycling facilities. The new directive on electrical waste is intended to provide the authorities with a legally binding basis that allows them to define quite clearly what is waste and what is a used product. When fridges or mobile phones are taken out of use, expensive raw materials such as gold, copper or silver should be reused in Europe. Moreover, proper reuse would reduce the amount of electrical waste that poisons people and the environment. The directive has noble aims, but it remains to be seen what impact it has in practice.

               –Directive 2002/96/EC, which has been in force since 13 February 2003, concerns waste electrical and electronic equipment, and is currently being revised. The aim of this is to address some difficulties that have arisen in applying the directive, for example, by setting out the scope of the directive more clearly, as well as seeking a balance between the attempt to ensure a uniform application of the directive and the need to conserve areas of flexibility, which enable the specific needs of each Member State to be addressed. Parliament’s position is part of this effort to find balanced and appropriate solutions in order to meet these objectives. I therefore voted in favour, in view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety’s recommendation for second reading.</literal>

               –Belgium is European champion in the collection of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), a title not to be taken lightly with almost 10 kg of domestic appliances collected per inhabitant thanks to the efficiency of the Recupel system, which has existed since 2001. This figure is encouraging for the protection of the environment and much higher than the minimum annual collection target of 4 kg per inhabitant established in 2003 by the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment. Of course, Belgium and Europe can always do better and build on the new and very ambitious collection targets established on the basis of the agreement reached between the European Parliament and the Council, which was finalised this afternoon with the adoption of the report by Karl-Heinz Florenz: a collection target of 65% for 2019 established on the basis of the volume of WEEE placed on the market in the three preceding years, a new scope extended to photovoltaic panels in six years, and the encouragement of Member States to separate waste so that it can be re-used. For the picture to be complete, the European Union must also set an example beyond its borders by combating the illegal export of hazardous electronic waste to third countries, which is a genuine health and environmental scourge, notably on the African continent.</literal>

               –During today’s plenary session, we voted on the report by Mr Florenz on waste electrical and electronic equipment.

Today, new environmental targets were approved in agreement with the Council. Updating the 2003 directive on the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) also makes it possible for consumers to return small volume WEEE to retailers, thus cutting red tape for businesses.

The Member States must gradually increase the collection of WEEE: by 2016, they will have to collect 45 tonnes of WEEE for every 100 tonnes of e-goods placed on the market in the preceding three years. By 2019, the figure will have to rise to 65% or, alternatively, it should be possible to collect 85% of WEEE generated.

Ten countries that have to improve their infrastructure, not including Italy, will have an interim target of 40% and will be able to request a postponement until 2021 to achieve the final target. Once the Council has formally approved the new rules, and these are published in the Official Journal, the Member States will have 18 months to transpose the provisions into their national legislation.</literal>

We were the only ones to make proposals on nanomaterials: we failed to get information requirements for producers on nanomaterials in EEE, but we managed to have the Commission assess whether selective treatment is necessary for nanomaterials in EEE.</literal>

               –In Europe, 9.3 million electrical and electronic items are sold every year. These products include refrigerators, ovens, washing machines, irons, televisions, computers, telephones and compact fluorescent lamps, all of which constitute a large amount of waste that will have to be recycled one day. It is estimated that more than eight million tonnes of electronic waste was produced in Europe in 2005, that is, 20 kg per inhabitant. That total is expected to reach 12.3 million tonnes by 2020. The EU had a duty to fill the regulatory gaps that were preventing this waste from being properly managed, as regards collection, recovery, recycling and combating its illegal export. The collection rate for waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in EU Member States should reach 45% of volumes placed on the market in the next four years and 65% in the next seven years. In addition, this directive makes provision for strengthening producers’ maximised responsibility, increasing the collection targets of household and professional WEEE, increasing recycling targets and reducing administrative burdens for businesses. I am therefore in favour of this latest step that is being taken towards an environmentally-friendly and resource-efficient economy.</literal>

               –In my view, the compromise agreement reached at the informal trialogue on 20 December is a good result in terms of safeguarding the recycling of small household appliances and the resulting protection of the environment.

The WEEE Directive currently in force already requires the Member States to carry out separated collections of electrical and electronic equipment and sets recovery and recycling targets. The old text applies the producer responsibility principle and obliges the Member States to collect an average of at least four kilograms of electrical and electronic waste per inhabitant per year.

The recast we voted on this morning, however, adds important details, such as setting a collection rate of 65% to be achieved by 2016, laying down reuse targets, raising recycling targets by 5%, with a specific target for medical equipment, and reducing administrative costs for producers arising from registration and reporting procedures.

One point that I consider particularly encouraging is the obligation on retailers to collect small items even without the purchase of equivalent new items, limited though only to sales outlets with a surface area greater than 400 mwith a collection point that can be set up in the immediate vicinity of the shop.</literal>

In the case of WEEE from private households, Member States are creating systems allowing this waste to be returned free of charge. Some Member States, including Romania, may, due to the lack of required infrastructure and the low level of EEE consumption, decide to achieve, within four years of the directive’s entry into force, a collection rate of between 40 and 45% of the average weight of EEE placed on the market in the three preceding years, and postpone the achievement of the final collection rate mentioned in Article 7(1) until a future date which must not be later than nine years after the directive’s entry into force.

This directive, although in itself insufficient, is a step in the right direction as regards the aim of bringing about an environmental transformation in our society. It is based on three decisions: producing sustainable equipment, fully reusing materials from end-of-life products, and involving local actors in this recycling process. It is also necessary for this directive to be properly implemented on the basis of specific criteria, such as the ‘creation of convenient facilities, including public collection points, where private households should be able to return their waste at least free of charge’; the implementation by Member States of an 85% minimum collection rate for WEEE; the free provision of information by producers about preparation for re-use and treatment of each type of new EEE placed on the market within one year of the equipment being placed on the market. The environmental transition process also requires this type of policy decision.</literal>

For many of our enterprises – and this is particularly true in my home region of Saxony, one of Europe’s leading centres of research and high technology – these raw materials are therefore indispensable. The extraction of metals from electrical and electronic waste has therefore become an important topic again. Considerable potential exists in electrical equipment such as computers and mobile phones. In Germany, we are already very good at recycling compared with many other Member States, but even here, many important raw materials are lost in electrical waste – whether legally or illegally. That is not just ecologically and socially questionable; it is also increasingly an economic problem. To me, therefore, extracting and retrieving raw materials as effectively as possible while ensuring an end to the illegal shipping of electrical waste to developing countries, where it poisons people, is one of the most important achievements of this directive. In future, then, it is the contractor and not the customs authorities that must prove in controls that the equipment is serviceable and is not electrical waste, so that we can stem the tide of illegal exports. I am therefore pleased that the environment ministers and Parliament have been able to reach agreement on this.</literal>

We are spending most of our time and energy dealing with the consequences. We see a huge amount of electrical and electronic waste that is, in many cases, highly toxic; we also see that further raw materials are needed for the manufacture of new electronic appliances. We think it fair that the costs of collection and treatment of electrical and electronic waste should be borne by the manufacturer and, ultimately, the purchaser of the product. The submitted draft draws on these considerations. The real problem, however, is the service life of electrical and electronic equipment. Introducing a mandatory minimum warranty period of two years looks like a significant step towards higher quality, until we realise that most manufacturers understand the word ‘minimum’ to mean the threshold beyond which it does not pay to continue because costs would increase. I therefore think that until manufacturers, and consequently consumers, start to see recycling as an item that is comparable in terms of cost with a substantial lengthening of the service life of products, our efforts to bring about the use of electrical and electronic waste will have only limited results.</literal>

Biocidal products are necessary for the control of organisms that are harmful to human or animal health and for the control of organisms that cause damage to natural or manufactured products. Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (hereinafter ‘the directive’) establishes a harmonised regulatory framework for the authorisation and the placing on the market of biocidal products and the establishment of a positive list of active substances that may be used in biocidal products. The directive’s provisions require the Commission to draw up a report seven years after its entry into force and to submit the report to the Council. The review of the implementation of the directive has indicated that for the evaluation of active substances, the simplified procedures provided for in the directive, notably for low risk products, have no real effect, and that in addition, the data requirements and data waiving provisions may be unclear or inconsistently applied or lead to a disproportionate burden in some circumstances. The new regulation is seeking to improve the existing regulatory framework, without reducing the high level of protection for the environment and human and animal health, to increase the free movement of biocidal products within the Union, and to reduce the administrative burden for companies and public authorities.</literal>

On Wednesday, we overwhelmingly adopted a resolution that harmonises the European market for biocidal products and establishes new deadlines for assessing applications in order to better protect human health and the environment. It is unprecedented in its inclusion of specific, comprehensive measures on nanomaterials. There was an urgent need to fill this gap in EU legislation. Those objects sold on the market and treated with biocides will therefore be required to mention on their label all the products used. With regard to substances considered carcinogenic or toxic for genes, reproduction or hormones, these will be strictly prohibited with the aim of protecting citizens and encouraging manufacturers to innovate by developing new, safer products. A word of caution, however. We should remain alert to new authorisations and the granting of renewals for exceptions. Member States will be able to make an exception only when absolutely necessary.

               –Biocidal products represent the third largest group of substances that are dangerous to human health and the environment, especially as they are products that people come into contact with on a daily basis. They are often non-biodegradable and are sometimes carcinogenic toxic substances that may prove to be harmful to people, animals and the environment when they are used and then disposed of as waste. They enter the food chain, soil and water. Although the present legislation is the product of a compromise, it has achieved significant progress since it was first adopted in 1998. The following are regulated by law: a drastic reduction in carcinogenic substances and substances classified as toxic for reproduction; the facility for Member States to impose a ban or restriction where specific circumstances so warrant; stricter licensing; improved labelling and a ban on misleading information; a reduction in animal testing; the substitution of safer alternatives for dangerous substances; separate safety tests and labelling of products containing nanomaterials. All these are a sign of positive developments which will benefit public health and the environment and advocate a vote in favour of the new regulation.</literal>

The most important of the amendments proposed by Parliament and accepted by the Council are those of a technical nature, on consistency, throughout the text and in this regulation and other EU legislative texts, on simplifying the text, and on eliminating duplications of legal obligations. I recognise that the introduction of an EU authorisation system is essential; that is, it represents a significant and crucial step towards a harmonised European market for biocidal products. This will undoubtedly be the best and most efficient system for improving the availability of these products, providing incentives for innovation and creating added value for human health and protecting nature. However, I believe considerable efforts must still be made to improve it, with the aim of ensuring that the objectives are achieved, such as eliminating the shortcomings of Directive 98/8/EC on authorisation and streamlining decision making, while developing a high level of protection.</literal>

This regulation also makes the data requirements for products clearer and more visible, for example, through labelling, while also minimising the possibility of animal testing, increasing the involvement of the European Chemicals Agency and ensuring the uniform application of these rules throughout the EU. I would congratulate my colleague, Ms Klass, on the political compromise which she has managed to achieve with the other parliamentary groups, the Commission and the Council. However, I share her doubts as to the authorisation of active substances/biocidal products, which should move towards greater EU-level centralisation, in order to avoid duplications and increase safety.

Biocides, which are products used to combat harmful organisms such as bacteria and parasites, can be used to protect both human and animal health, so they need to be clearly regulated with a framework directive requiring them to be used sustainably. Although their use has a markedly positive effect on our lives, we must be vigilant in order to eliminate carcinogens or products that cause infertility, as well as to cancel out potential side effects. The measures just adopted improve the certification process, reduce bureaucracy and consolidate the single market through standardisation; what is allowed in a country like Italy or France will also be allowed in Portugal or Spain.

This report contains some improvements on the first reading, which are the result of the compromise reached in negotiations between the groups. The most important of the positive aspects includes a more obvious concern with ensuring a high level of protection for human and animal health and the environment, as well as matters relating to labelling containing information for the consumer that is not misleading, as in the possible use of nanomaterials.

The purpose of the regulation in question is to increase the free movement of biocidal products within the European Union. In order to remove, as much as possible, barriers to trade in biocidal products that stem from the different levels of protection in the Member States, harmonised rules should be laid down for the approval of active substances and the placing on the market and use of such products, including rules on the mutual recognition of authorisations and on parallel trade. In order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to compile an EU list of active substances that are authorised for use in biocidal products, and a procedure should also be established for assessing whether an active substance may be included in that list. The proposal also aims to simplify the rules on data protection, to avoid duplicating the preparation of studies, to improve the harmonisation of charging systems in the Member States, to introduce rules for parallel trade in biocidal products, and to include products or materials treated with biocidal products in the scope of the directive.</literal>

This definition is clearly stated in the corresponding European directive. Biocidal products are used in a great variety of areas and applications – for example, as wood preservatives. The European Biocidal Products Directive therefore distinguishes between 23 product types in four main groups (disinfectants and general biocidal products; preservatives; pest control; other biocidal products). Since 2009, biocidal products have been subject to an authorisation and registration procedure which takes place nationally in the individual Member States and which is based on an assessment by the authorities of their efficacy and their risks to humans, animals and the environment. Inadequate efficacy and unacceptable effects should thereby be avoided when the products are used as intended. Authorisation of a biocidal product also includes binding instructions as regards labelling and, where appropriate, directions for use. Where this report is concerned, I spoke in favour of the amendments to the original draft because I consider it important that the active substances that will be subject to a simplified authorisation procedure are now listed in the annex to the regulation.</literal>

The final compromise package, agreed as a result of the negotiations between the Council and Parliament, seems, in my view, to successfully marry the objective of a high level of protection of human health and the environment with that of a swifter and more efficient authorisation system for the industrial sector.

Among the main objectives of the proposal, I should like to highlight in particular the objective of increasing the level of protection of health and the environment by gradually eliminating the most hazardous substances and extending the scope to articles treated with biocidal products, together with more precise and enhanced procedures with regard to the placing on the market of active substances and biocidal products, updating the authorisation system and introducing simplification and harmonisation.

For this reason, I voted in favour of the measure.</literal>

I am voting for this regulation, as I believe that a list of active substances approved for use in biocidal products should be drawn up. These should be regularly examined to take account of developments in science and technology, and the Member States should be notified well in advance of companies making the products available. Finally, I believe that this regulation will contribute towards greater legal certainty and transparency in the use of active substances, ensure a high level of protection for both human and animal health and the environment, and improve the functioning of the internal market through the harmonisation of the rules on the placement on the market and use of biocidal products.</literal>

The report seeks to strike a balance between the use of these types of products in their capacity to improve human health and the fight against their negative impact on the environment and health. In the medium term, all these products must go through three stages of assessment in order to measure the extent to which they are dangerous (particularly if they are carcinogenic or toxic for the hormone system) before being validated by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and placed on the market.

               –Biocidal products are intended to destroy, deter and render harmless harmful organisms. Many can be harmful to humans or animals. Therefore, each country monitors their use very closely and takes care that they are used only when necessary and that they do not endanger people. The regulation on biocidal products harmonising the market rules for these products is necessary for two reasons. Above all, it assures EU citizens that each manufacturer must meet the same strict conditions in order for its product to be offered for sale. Producers must therefore maintain the same standards for the protection of human health and the environment. This uniform approach is, however, also beneficial for producers. It reduces the costs of certification of their products and enables them to supply their products to any EU country without having to undergo demanding authorisation procedures many times. This creates room for innovations in biocidal products and improves their availability. Competition is enhanced and this has a positive impact on prices. Moreover, a central authorisation system contributes to better consumer protection.</literal>

               –I am voting in favour because higher food prices do not automatically translate into higher farm incomes, and this report expresses that concern. The steady and marked increase in production costs has not been fairly passed along the food supply chain, and has been particularly affecting farmers’ incomes, leading to a constant feeling of insecurity in agriculture. The situation is of particular concern for farmers in isolated regions, such as the outermost regions, for which the factors of distance and isolation already entail additional costs. As such, it is vital to promote transparency in order to identify what is leading to this situation, so encouraging resilience in the face of price volatility. That is the only way to provide a supply chain that treats all those involved in the process fairly, both up- and downstream, and farmers and consumers in particular.</literal>

               –The report confines itself to describing the problem of falling agricultural incomes because it wants to hide the causes that generate the problem, reduce agricultural incomes and decimate the income of the working and grassroots family with rocketing food prices. Surprisingly, it barely mentions the fact that energy, fertilisers, plant health products, water, seeds, fodder and so on belong to and are controlled by international monopolies, which set the prices and negate the effort made by farmers and working consumers, in order to increase their profits. Subsidised EU programmes promote the concentration of land in large farm holdings within the framework of the CAP and its reform post-2013. The privatisation of water is making it more expensive to use; the same applies to increased charges and prices for energy. The report supports the EU CAP, which is a disaster for farmers of poor and medium-sized holdings, and promotes the ‘competitiveness’ of farming in the EU, which means the concentration of land in large capitalist undertakings and the mass expulsion of poor farmers from their fields. The only way forward for farmers of poor and medium-sized holdings is to fight the CAP and all the EU’s anti-grassroots policies, to join forces with the working class and urban freelancers, and to bring about a radical change in power and the economy.</literal>

Farmers need support in improving agronomic and environmental performance in order to address the new climate, environmental and economic challenges.

With this ambitious text, the European Parliament calls on national and European competition authorities involved in production and commerce to take action against abusive buyer practices on the part of dominant wholesalers and retailers. More specifically, for the competitiveness of European agriculture, it was vital to bring up the issue of rising costs of purchased farm inputs over the past decade in the fields of energy, machinery, compound feed, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds and water. It is therefore important to avoid distortions of competition and, by solving problems upstream of agricultural production, to improve farmers’ incomes. The overall aim is to have a better distribution policy, to guarantee that all products have the same quality standards within the EU, and to allow producers to have more influence in the food chain. Finally, through this text, I support the EU’s considerable investment in projects that promote sustainable agriculture.</literal>

The vulnerability of the agri-food sector and the volatility of prices, especially of inputs, today make the sector highly unfair and do not help the efficiency and sustainability of the agricultural chain. However, I have to say that references to the issue of climate change, which have nothing to do with the question of farm inputs, are too numerous and insistent. Furthermore, the rapporteur proposes setting up a new European price monitoring agency to prevent and rectify distortions in input prices. One more agency involves increasing EU spending without it being possible to reasonably foresee, in this case as in many others unfortunately, a benefit from its establishment.

               –I voted in favour of this report because I agree that with the growing cost of resources used in agriculture, we need to optimise agricultural production processes and improve resource management as much as possible. In my opinion, this would not only enable farmers to reduce input costs and increase their autonomy and income, but would also be a move to a more sustainable and user-friendly method of farming. For example, energy costs over the last decade have risen by approximately 60%, while farm gate prices have only increased by 25%. This report therefore proposes taking measures to increase the ability of farms to save energy in buildings, farming practices and transport use, and to invest in the production of renewable energy on farms or locally. Another area where management could be improved and savings could thus be made is the use of fertilisers and soil improvers. Solutions include improving farm nutrient analysis and management and better soil fertility analysis and management. Opting to use farm-saved seeds instead of certified seeds is another means of increasing the efficiency of agricultural production proposed by the report. Farm-saved seeds carry not only economic but environmental advantages – on average, they cost 40% less than certified seeds, they allow farmers to grow plants which are adapted to the specific agronomic conditions in their regions, and they often require less fertilisers, while at the same time maintaining crop biodiversity.</literal>

In view of this, I consider it important that this report analyses upstream structures and markets and suggests policy options which can help farmers to reduce input costs, with a view to increasing their autonomy and income, and enabling them to move to the more efficient and sustainable use of production resources. I applaud the call to Member States and the Commission to deliver more data on input and production costs, which should then be analysed and regularly provided to farmers by a European price monitoring agency. Price indices might also improve competition in the input sector, and perhaps help farmers to move out of a ‘squeeze position’ between the increasingly concentrated and powerful agro-industry upstream and downstream of primary production.</literal>

I also agree with the rapporteur on the need to support farmers so that they not only improve their agronomic and environmental performance, but also so that they can respond more effectively to climatic, environmental and economic challenges, particularly by adopting ‘greening measures’, and thus invest in greater resilience to climatic instability, increased soil health and fertility, and lower susceptibility to diseases.</literal>

All Eurostat findings come together to show the disparity between the increase in input costs and that of farm gate prices. The report, which I voted in favour of, has the merit of precisely indicating the sectors for action, both hoping for an enhanced and more constant commitment to tackling the formation of cartels among suppliers of the main inputs (seeds and fertilisers), and setting out an environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial transformation of resource supply systems.</literal>

At a time when the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2013 is being discussed, it is pertinent to discuss the problems affecting this strategic sector of the EU in order to halt the flow of people abandoning farming, which jeopardises not only the lack of certain agricultural products, but, above all, the ecosystems associated with this activity in rural and mountainous areas. This is an extremely important and topical report and I voted for it, since it draws attention to the real problems existing in the farm input supply chain and identifies the measures to be taken. An economic activity in which input costs have increased by 60% over a decade, while product costs have risen by only 25%, as has happened in the case of energy costs, is not sustainable. Energy efficiency should be a priority in the new CAP.

Substantial policy changes were proposed in EU competition law and recommendations were made for measures to be included in legislative proposals. The Commission adopted a follow-up note on this resolution in November 2010, in which it announced action in this matter. I believe that it is necessary to provide support for farmers in improving their agronomic and environmental performance, so that they can cope with the new climatic, environmental and economic challenges that they will have to face. Regarding ecological measures, farmers will probably have to reintegrate outsourced production costs associated with better management of biodiversity, water and soil nutrients, and it is for this reason that they will have to be given support. There is, however, an assumption that this initial expenditure will bring benefits to farmers from the long-term perspective, such as resistance to climatic instability, healthier and more productive land, and less vulnerability to disease. If they better learn to exploit the opportunities stemming from these inputs, they will also become more resistant to price fluctuations.</literal>

Not only is Europe highly dependent on imports of fossil fuels, but also of animal feed, phosphates and other inputs. The report does not provide any solutions, however, apart from asking the Commission for many new reports and more in-depth studies. It calls on the Commission to address the fact that the majority of phosphate rock comes from five countries. Even if the Commission lies down on a map of the world, it is not going to be able to change that situation. The report states that ‘cheaper feed (is) available on the global market’. This is particularly true of genetically modified (GM) soya, which makes up 80% of world production. However, the rapporteur is a figurehead of the anti-GM food movement, and he is fighting against shale gas, which is plentiful in Europe and could help to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels if exploited.

We now have a world population of 7 billion; in 2027, it is projected that the world population will reach 8 billion, and in 2046, 9 billion! This means that decreasing numbers of farmers will have to double food production, while also battling climate change and maintaining food standards. The total input costs for EU farmers climbed, on average, by almost 40% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices have increased by only 25%. Farmers are living on their overdrafts or savings and that cannot continue.

               – I welcome this new own-initiative report which identifies problems upstream of farm production, focusing on rising costs of purchased farm inputs over the past decade in the fields of energy, machinery, compound feed, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds and water. It points at impact on several production sectors, highlights the growing dependence of farmers on an increasingly concentrated input industry, and suggests measures to be taken within the upcoming CAP reform.</literal>

All this has clear and significant effects on several production sectors. We therefore believe it is vital to support the policy options suggested here by the rapporteur, with the aim of helping farmers to reduce input costs, with a view to increasing their autonomy and income, so as to move to a more efficient and sustainable use of production resources.</literal>

               –This report describes the predominance of three companies in the seeds market, which contributes to keeping prices high and has a negative impact on crop diversity. It therefore requests that farmers continue to be able to use seeds produced on their own farms; this possibility is currently under threat. The report calls for incentives encouraging farmers to organise themselves collectively, in order to increase their bargaining power, improve their resource management and reduce their vulnerability to price volatility. It recommends the monitoring of access to land, especially for young farmers, which is compromised by the excessive cost of leases. It also proposes measures for energy saving and a reduction in the use of fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides and soil improvers, and local production of crops for animal feed. In short, the report seeks to reduce production costs by proposing measures that break with the concentration of powerful agro-industry in the agricultural market. I voted for the report because I agree with the direction that it is taking, but I believe that it is only one step, and that more measures are needed to ensure a fairer farm input supply chain in social, economic and environmental terms.</literal>

               –The strategic importance of agriculture in ensuring food security in the European Union requires that Member States and the Commission adopt measures and stimuli, effectively and swiftly, for its sustainable development and competitiveness. Although agriculture is subject to the rules of competition, the reality of the market in many Member States shows that abuse of market dominance by suppliers of inputs is widespread. The high concentration in the agricultural inputs sector should therefore be a signal for the national anti-monopoly bodies that anti-competitive activities, such as abuse of market dominance, can be taking place to the detriment of producers and of end consumers. The competent authorities of the Member States should ensure improved competition in agriculture by monitoring the situation in the relevant markets more closely and, where violations are found, by imposing deterrent fines.</literal>

Meanwhile, if we take an integrated approach to this issue and take integrated action, we could reduce these costs while also achieving other positive results. Above all, I am talking about the prudent and efficient use of resources associated with production – energy and fertilisers. A change in the attitude and habits of the producers themselves would not only save resources and reduce costs but would also contribute to environmental conservation – greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced and fewer chemical substances would be released into the soil and water bodies.</literal>

Farmers are faced with a dire situation, starting with the leasing of land, especially in my country, Bulgaria, where 90% of livestock farmers do not own the land they use, then proceeding to the high prices for resources and materials, and ending with low farm gate prices. We need to adopt a two-pronged approach in order to tackle this situation. One aspect is linked to the work done by the institutions and competition authorities. We need to examine the reasons for the high prices for materials and avoid the situation where agribusiness traders are in a dominant position and engaging in unfair competition. Secondly, we must help farmers themselves to discover alternative ways of offsetting high prices, managing their resources effectively and adopting efficient, energy-saving measures, as well as of encouraging processing. Furthermore, we must not burden producers with other requirements and administrative procedures where fulfilling them will push their costs up even more.</literal>

I consider it important to emphasise the need for greater cooperation and organisation among farmers – for instance, by collectively purchasing and storing inputs, cooperating in order to improve the use of resources, etc. Another means of increasing farmers’ income is to concentrate on the reduction of production costs – over the past ten years, production has become significantly more costly to farmers due to the overall rise in energy prices. In order to achieve some manner of harmonisation between expenses and income, agricultural producers must implement more and more energy and resource sustainable methods in production processes. As a result, in addition to the gathering of data concerning input and production costs, it would also be necessary to provide European farmers with guidelines regarding the best production solutions and practices, as stated in this report.</literal>

Furthermore, an effectively functioning farm input supply chain will contribute to a more efficient and sustainable use of production resources. Attention is drawn to the fact that due to resource scarcity, growing demand for food and EU farmers’ limited opportunities to obtain cheaper feed on the world market, upward pressure on input prices is constantly rising. It is therefore very important to ensure that farmers are given proper support so that agricultural and environmental performance improves and new climatic, environmental and economic challenges are addressed. I believe that in the next research framework programme, more funds need to be allocated for research and development in the efficient use and management of farm inputs and improving agronomic efficiency. Enhanced cooperation between the public and private sectors, as well as farmers’ organisations, should also be encouraged at EU level. In order to increase their purchasing power, farmers must be encouraged to collectively organise the storage and purchase of inputs and to form groups for better resource management and sustainable practices.</literal>

               –In addition to the difficulties that farmers experience in bringing products onto the market, exacerbated by their weak bargaining position with distributors, they have seen a gradual rise in input prices. While farm gate prices have increased by around 25% over the last decade, energy costs have increased by about 60%, fertilisers and soil improvers by around 100%, seeds and animal feed by about 30%, costs for non-residential farm buildings by around 20%, and plant protection products and other pesticides by 13%. The increased cost of industrial machinery is also noteworthy. In overall terms, costs for European farmers increased by 40% over the same period. It will come as no surprise, then, that EU farm incomes have fallen by 11.6% since 2009, according to Eurostat data. The difficult obstacles that farmers face can only be overcome with a comprehensive response that helps to restructure agricultural production, reducing its dependence on the volatility of demand and the inputs market. I voted for this report and I agree with this approach, and I hope that the next common agricultural policy will provide a response to these problems.</literal>

               – In favour. In its resolution of 7 September 2010 on ‘Fair revenues for farmers: towards a better functioning food supply chain in Europe’, Parliament adopted a number of recommendations to solve problems downstream of farm production in order to improve farmers’ incomes. Parliament suggested substantial policy change in EU competition law and made recommendations for measures to be included in the legislative proposals on CAP 2020 reform. The Commission adopted, on 23 November 2010, a follow-up note on this resolution, which announces action in this matter. This new initiative report identifies problems upstream of farm production, focusing on rising costs of purchased farm inputs over the past decade in the fields of energy, machinery, compound feed, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds and water.

EU agriculture is currently highly dependent on input imports (mainly fossil fuels, animal feed and scarce soil-improving minerals such as phosphate) and is vulnerable to price hikes. This has therefore raised major concerns about EU farmers’ competitiveness.

Here, we want to emphasise that the high volatility in agricultural commodity and farm input prices has increased insecurity among farmers with regard to their income and long-term investments. The Member States and the Commission must therefore improve the transparency of farm input prices and guarantee that competition rules are enforced. Greater availability of data on input costs would help farmers.</literal>

The existence of a balance of power heavily in favour of distributors and to the detriment of farmers is well documented. It condemns many of the latter to misery by no longer allowing them to make a living from their work with dignity. This paper asks, therefore, that we redress the balance and that we promote sustainable agriculture that respects the environment through limited importation and limited use of these input products. Emphasis is also placed on training farmers and agronomists and on technical developments with a view to promoting the European Union’s food sovereignty and protecting Europeans better against food shortages.

At the same time, the Commission is working on a retail action plan and on a communication mapping and assessing existing rules on unfair practices, and has clearly indicated that it will continue to pursue the strategy of consensus. More needs to be done, but it is important to give the ongoing process a chance. Asking for robust legislation at this stage would risk derailing this and undermining the climate of trust. We will continue to put pressure on all the parties concerned and will evaluate the results at the yearly Retail Roundtable, based on facts and data. If self-regulation and the dialogue framed in the High-Level Forum for the Supply Chain should prove insufficient, all options – including legislation – remain open.</literal>

The former, in particular, have seen a constant increase in production costs, while at the same time losing bargaining power vis-à-vis distributors. This imbalance is threatening to jeopardise the viability of many farms, which can only worry policy makers, particularly in the EU, in view of the possibility of the desertification of rural areas and increased unemployment in traditionally less developed regions. This pressure on producers is particularly significant in the outermost regions of the EU. I hope that a fairer and more transparent relationship might be possible between the various stakeholders in this market, without jeopardising its fundamental freedom, as this would guard against abuse of a dominant position and enable greater stability for farmers, as well as healthier competition.</literal>

Firstly, we all recognise that agriculture is a strategic sector of the EU economy and that, in order to respond to future challenges in terms of food, natural resources and the environment, a certain level of reform of the common agricultural policy is absolutely crucial.

Secondly, there are problems with the food supply chain, from producer to consumer, which need to be resolved, particularly improper trading practices intended only to take money from the producers. I therefore welcome the information from the Commission, under the Single Market Act, on the adoption of a communication on these trading practices and misleading advertising.

Thirdly, as agriculture is the subject of the first integrated European policy, it is essential that it be the focus for resolving the crisis, as the food supply of 500 million Europeans is at stake. There is an urgent need to acknowledge the role of farmers and free them from the stranglehold in which they find themselves, caught between input costs and exploitation by the chains bringing their products to market.</literal>

This threatens the survival of many agricultural enterprises, has serious consequences for the food supply chain in the European Union, and exacerbates the trade balance problem. This results in a growing need for imports and also leads to dependence on unstable foreign markets.

We need to tackle these risks and insist on a clear definition of abusive and unfair practices often perpetrated to the detriment of farmers, and conduct an information campaign for farmers on the most common illegal contractual and commercial practices together with the instruments at their disposal to report abuses.</literal>

The food supply chain, agriculture, the agri-food industry and the distribution sector represent over 5% of European added value and 7% of jobs. Moreover, the agri-food industry generates EUR 1 400 billion per year, a figure greater than that generated by any other sector.

In the context of the discussions on the sector’s competitiveness, any dysfunction of the food supply chain can have serious economic and social consequences for farmers, agricultural cooperatives and rural areas, and that is precisely what is happening. Price trends in recent years, both for production and consumption, have clearly shown the imbalance of power that exists within the food chain.

That is a serious threat to the sustainability of the sector, especially for agriculture. At present, European consumers spend 13% of their household income to buy food, as opposed to 30% in the early 1980s. I therefore hope that, with the resolution adopted today, the issue is tackled again, but this time in order to find an effective solution.</literal>

Yet space policy is a key element of the Europe 2020 strategy and we believe that the Galileo programme, the first satellite navigation system in the world designed for civilian use and which will provide a viable alternative to the American Global Positioning System (GPS), cannot be funded without the GMES programme. We must remember that GMES is a state-of-the-art environmental information tool that will enable us, in particular, to respond to the environmental challenges of the 21st century and that it is crucial to continue its funding.</literal>

However, this needs to be utilised. The Galileo global navigation satellite system will boost industries which need secure, accurate positioning services, such as transport, security and medical services. It is estimated that this will have an economic impact for industry of around EUR 90 billion in the next 20 years. I should stress the importance of devising a research and innovation strategy for space policy. At the same time, technological progress should be secured by steady long-term funding. This is why the promotion of public-private partnerships is of vital importance in this area. A competitive space industry would be conducive to European access to space and orbital infrastructures.</literal>

The report advocates a European space strategy based on a set of programmes that either currently exist or are in development, such as Galileo, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, Single European Sky ATM Research and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). We have funding set aside for these programmes, which relates to their possible use for military purposes. That is the case with the GMES programme, which is aimed at global monitoring for the environment and security, and which includes earth observation and the ‘extraction of precise and useful data’ for preparing military operations and for covert ‘border surveillance’, as well as to ‘support EU External Action’, in addition to risk prevention, emergency management and coastal surveillance. This type of use – for military ends – is of serious concern to us. The Commission, like this report, not only fails to rule this out, but actually opens the door to it.</literal>

Unfortunately, European companies which deploy satellite communication systems are confining their activities to Europe and reducing their staff, while production is being shifted to other continents. The SARTRE programme funded by the Commission, whose aim is to implement technologies allowing vehicles to be driven in platoons via satellite, provides significant added value to research and innovation in the EU. The institutions and companies involved in the project benefit from the European space infrastructure, thereby helping increase safety and ease of use in terms of traffic, with a reduced environmental impact.

Romania has joined the European Space Agency (ESA) and is due to be an institutional partner in Euclid, a scientific space mission. Romania is also having its first experience of space with the launch of the Goliath satellite. The European Space Agency’s space systems enable the development of space applications for agriculture, the environment, transport, disaster assessment and telemedicine.</literal>

There is no doubt that space policy is a great opportunity for Europe because it stimulates technological innovation, because it helps to make European citizens more secure, because it creates synergies in a strategic civil and military sector, and, finally, because it creates jobs for highly qualified workers.

It is therefore right that the project should play a key role in the Europe 2020 strategy. That said, it is all too plain that in terms of governance, the Commission could and should have drawn up a more ambitious plan. The failure to include it in the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 risks undermining the investments made so far.

In the first instance, the priority measures for an EU space policy involve the flagship projects, Galileo and Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES). As regards the use of space technologies for security (monitoring of borders, maritime surveillance, emergency management, humanitarian aid, support for the EU’s external action), the Union will have to coordinate properly the existing capacities of Member States, under conditions to be agreed with Member States owning infrastructure, in order to satisfy operational requirements, which may also include developing new infrastructure.

Space technologies will also have to be protected as infrastructures against damage or destruction by gradually phasing in the sharing of existing Member State capacity, purchasing any capacity not currently available, and properly maintaining and managing it.

The European Union will then be able to play a key role in the field of space exploration, overcoming the dispersion in current interventions, identifying and supporting the development of exploration technologies in the fields of energy, health and support for isolated environments.</literal>

The EGNOS and Galileo programmes are both key elements of EU space strategy which makes air travel safer by improving the accuracy of position – the new technology gives pilots their position to within a couple of metres. While I appreciate that new satellite technology can help improve passenger safety, we must be mindful of costs at a time of economic austerity. Last year, the Commission revealed that it would need a further EUR 2 billion to complete the Galileo project. The entire project will cost EUR 22 billion, almost entirely funded by the EU taxpayer. When this system was first proposed, we were told that costs would be considerably lower and that private investment would mean that taxpayers would only have to foot a bill of around EUR 2.5 billion.

What food is produced and in what quantities depends on whether the multinationals will make a profit and is not designed to address global hunger. That is why the wish-list in the report cannot address the problem.

Lastly, the resolution calls for the Commission to amend the public procurement rules on catering and hospitality services, so that when contracts are awarded, priority is given to ‘undertakings that guarantee that they will redistribute free of charge any unallocated (unsold) items to groups of citizens who lack purchasing power (…)’.

Irish consumers throw out 30% of the food bought in supermarkets, at a cost of EUR 1 000 each year for every household. This is the same across the EU and unless something is done, food waste in the EU will grow from 90 million tonnes now to 126 million tonnes by the year 2020.

It is an ugly situation that food waste will grow by 40% when problems with the safety of food supply and with poverty are worsening. There is evidence that it is EU households who generate the most avoidable food waste – 42% of the total – and the recommendations of the report in relation to improving consumer knowledge of food labelling and end dates of food (for example, ‘sell by’ and ‘use by’ dates) must be implemented without delay.

Initiatives have already been launched in various Member States aimed at collecting unsold and discarded products locally throughout the food supply chain in order to redistribute them to citizens below the minimum income threshold, and Member States should exchange best practices in this area.

               –The Caronna report addresses an important issue, that of the efficiency of the food chain in EU Member States. Food wastage statistics show that, in some cases, almost 50% of healthy edible food is lost along the food supply chain. This has repercussions not only for the sustainability of the food chain and for food production itself, but also for product prices and the eco-sustainability of food waste. The report therefore calls on the Commission, the Council and the governments of Member States to promote measures and policies that first of all foster greater awareness of the problem on the part of citizens. It also calls on the Commission and the Council to declare 2012 the ‘European Year against Food Waste’, precisely in order to raise awareness among institutions and consumers about the various kinds of damage caused by losing massive amounts of food along the food supply chain and, conversely, on the desirability of a change of course in this area. It is also desirable, as the report points out, for the Commission to foster the exchange of good practices among Member States. I voted in favour of the report.</literal>

               –I voted in favour of this report because reducing food waste, responding to the increase in demand predicted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and improving people’s nutritional levels are the first important step in combating global hunger. Every year in Europe, an increasing amount of healthy, edible food is lost along the entire food supply chain, in some cases, all the way up to the consumer, and becomes waste. Furthermore, food waste not only has ethical, economic, social and nutritional implications, but also health and environmental ones, because unconsumed food mountains make a major contribution to global warming and food waste produces methane, which, as a greenhouse gas, is 21 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. The European Parliament therefore calls on the Council, the Commission, the Member States and players in the food supply chain to address as a matter of urgency the problem of food waste along the entire supply and consumption chain and to devise guidelines for, and support ways of, improving the efficiency of the food supply chain sector by sector. The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to assess and encourage measures to reduce food waste upstream, such as dual-date labelling (‘sell by’ and ‘use by’), and the discounted sale of foods close to their expiry date and of damaged goods.</literal>

This is why my colleagues and I are calling for urgent measures to halve food wastage by 2025 and to improve access to food for deprived people. With the future of the Food Aid Programme for the Most Deprived Persons having been threatened over the course of several months, there is a need to encourage the initiatives of some Member States to recover unsold food and the distributors should also participate in these programmes. That said, food wastage does not only concern the developed countries. It also affects developing countries which are forced to throw away tonnes of food due to a lack of adequate resources to preserve it in the production and distribution chains. We can and we must provide them with our practical support and know-how in this field to avoid the losses of food that are so crucial in some parts of the world. Solidarity must not stop at Europe’s borders.</literal>

               The fight against food wastage must become a priority political programme of the EU. The Commission, Council and Member States should draw up a concrete strategy and measures to halve food wastage throughout the supply chain by 2025, improving efficiency in the sector and increasing public awareness of this issue, many aspects of which are still little known. It is essential that citizens are informed not only about the causes and consequences of food wastage, but also about ways of preventing it. We must support a culture based on the principles of sustainability and solidarity between scientists and other citizens, thus encouraging better behaviour. Experience shows that, where implemented, the spontaneous initiatives of voluntary or professional associations aimed at introducing and raising the visibility of a culture directed against food wastage have considerable success.</literal>

               –Approximately 925 million people around the world are currently at risk of undernourishment. In the EU, 79 million people live below the poverty line, and of these, 16 million survive through food aid from charitable institutions. If we consider that the reduction of food wastage is an important step towards combating hunger in the world and improving people’s nutritional levels, it is unacceptable that almost 50% of perfectly healthy and edible food is lost every year throughout the food supply chain in Europe. There is a need to counter the growing trend of global food waste by adopting additional preventive measures, general guidelines and strategies aimed at improving the efficiency and sustainability of the food supply chain.

This will contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular, with regard to halving poverty and hunger by 2015. Finally, food waste and the production of surplus food as a result also constitutes an environmental and ethical problem, with economic and social costs and implications for the internal market, for both businesses and consumers.</literal>

That is environmentally, economically and morally unacceptable. With our more energy-efficient modern refrigerators, we could reduce the temperature in the supply chain for refrigerated foods in order to increase durability. We currently do not distinguish between the ‘best before’ date, which relates to quality, and the ‘use by’ date, which relates to safety. I have therefore asked the Commission to clarify these differences. With more types of labelling, we would risk confusing consumers more.

I do not agree with those who want to dictate from above. We must start to act now and not wait for detailed work to be done by the Commission. It is important for us to start at an early stage in schools. We need to teach our children to be careful with food. It is important to involve the food industry in providing information on how people can plan their shopping, store food and reuse leftovers in order to minimise wastage. We need to establish sustainable, informed and moderate consumption without compromising food safety. It is not possible to eradicate this problem with legislation. However, we can shape opinion, stimulate debate and increase awareness. The challenge that we all face is to change our attitudes and lifestyles. Everyone can make a difference, and together we can drive change.</literal>

               –That the level reached by the data on food waste has an ethical significance, as well as a social, economic and environmental one, is no longer surprising. Yet, despite the ever increasing amounts – according to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates, it may even reach 50% of the total produced – of goods lost along the entire food chain, in Europe, there is still no clear, unambiguous and uniform definition of the concept of ‘food waste’.

As if that were not enough, just a few months ago, we had to fight a fierce battle to refinance the fund for the distribution of food to the needy. In contrast to this is the data, deplorable in many ways, according to which Europeans and North Americans waste up to 115 kilograms of food per capita. This situation is no longer acceptable but, at the same time, it is hard to resolve.

One of the main virtues of this report is that it does not reduce the problem to its most obvious manifestation – waste generated by the end consumer – which, however deplorable, is but one part of a broader and more complex problem. Conversely, we need to identify intervention strategies tailored to the specific causes of waste for each of the five sectors (production, storage, processing, distribution, consumption) that make up the food supply chain.</literal>

In the United Kingdom alone, we throw away 7.2 million tonnes of food from our homes every year, and 4.4 million tonnes of this food could have been eaten. This issue has far-reaching implications for families across the UK, especially in the current economic climate. Food wastage costs the average family with children GBP 680 a year, the equivalent of GBP 50 a month. This brings the value of food wasted in the UK each year to a grand total of GBP 12 billion. Not only are there serious financial implications for the consumer in relation to food wastage, but there are also far-reaching issues surrounding the wastage of water, energy and packaging used in food production, transportation and storage. All of this goes to waste when we throw away perfectly good food.</literal>

               Food wastage is a serious global problem. It affects the entire food chain, from the producer to the final consumer, stretching from losses at harvest and storage through to poor securing of products during transportation, faulty packaging and the bad habits of final consumers when purchasing and using food. The paradox is that food is wasted both in industrialised and in developing countries. In industrialised countries, wastage occurs mainly during distribution and consumption, and is mainly due to the over-production of foodstuffs. In developing countries, food spoils right from the start of the chain due a lack of technology (for example, refrigeration equipment), the absence of transport systems and infrastructure and the lack of options for safe storage. There is little we can do about many of these factors: industrialised countries will not stop producing surpluses and the whole world cannot have advanced infrastructure and technology. However, we can do something right now about the disposal of food that can no longer be consumed. Most of this food ends up in mixed waste, and humanity thus produces millions of tonnes of mixed waste for which there is no space. The solution is to sort waste and to dispose of food biologically. Food recycled in this way can be returned to agriculture as natural fertiliser or humus. I welcome the start of the debate on this issue, and I will vote in favour of adopting the report.</literal>

               –This report addresses a problem that has become increasingly worrying: food wastage. The rapporteur seeks a holistic approach to the problem, covering the various links in the food supply chain and making proposals to make the chain more efficient. However, there are some significant shortcomings and even misunderstandings in the report. The extent of the problem of food wastage today is inseparable from the capitalist mode of production, the intensification of agriculture and the increased size of chains of production and consumption. It is important to note that small- and medium-scale agriculture, short supply chains, and local production and consumption are likely to reduce wastage and increase efficiency. Everything cannot, therefore, be put on the same level, and it is important to make this distinction. Moreover, in the context of current food supply chains, proposals such as food redistribution programmes for those in poverty and the application of discounts for products that are nearing expiry, apart from their charitable and welfare-related nature, mean dangerously opening the door to dumping and manipulation by the big retailers, which we cannot accept.</literal>

               –Food waste has assumed such proportions that it can be considered to be a global problem that is reflected right along the food supply chain. It occurs on farmland, in the processing industry, in distribution companies and in consumers’ homes. Food is wasted in industrialised countries and in developing countries. The wastage of food generates a chain parallel to the production chain and causes a whole series of negative externalities. The issue of food waste conflicts with the fundamental problem of food security, which is seriously compromised by a number of factors, including the limited natural resources compared to the growth in the world population and the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. Combating food waste must become a priority on Europe’s policy agenda. The Commission, Council and Member States should strive to adopt strategies and specific measures to reduce food waste throughout the supply chain, and to raise public awareness of this problem with a view to remedying the situation. People must be informed not only about the causes and effects of waste but also about ways of reducing it. For this reason, Parliament requests that 2013 be declared the European Year against Food Waste, serving as a key information and awareness-raising tool on this important issue.</literal>

               –Every year, about 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted around the world, roughly one-third of the food produced for human consumption. It is estimated that every European citizen throws away on average 179 kilograms of food per year, much of which is still edible. We must start off from these figures in order to adopt a coordinated European strategy and effective measures that can dramatically reduce food waste. To date, the European Union has underestimated this problem, fraught with consequences that are not only social but also economic and environmental. Recent studies show that no less than 10% of greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries derive from the production of food that is then thrown away on a daily basis. With the resolution adopted today, we are calling for an integrated and coordinated approach to be introduced – from producer to consumer – to significantly reduce food wastage. Awareness raising and consumer education will play a key role in promoting the idea that what is wasted can instead become a resource. This has been successfully demonstrated by the ‘last minute market’, a project set up by the University of Bologna, which promotes the ‘reuse’ of food within solidarity networks.</literal>

Wastage occurs along the entire food chain, from production to consumption.

When faced with a phenomenon which, in the last 30 years, has increased by 50%, with consequences that are not only ethical but also economic, environmental, social, nutritional and health-related, it does not seem ethically sustainable for about 80 million people in Europe to live below the poverty line. The tonnes of still edible food that are thrown into rubbish bins require disposal, a process which is often very expensive at both an economic and environmental level, and one which society itself is forced to pay when it could be doing much, often unconsciously, to limit its impact. I therefore believe that today’s vote is the start of a regulatory path through which, in future, we will be able to reconcile the needs of consumers, in terms of hygiene and information, through differentiated and simplified forms of packaging that are cheaper for businesses and which, therefore, lead to lower retail prices.</literal>

               –Food waste has assumed such proportions that it can be regarded as a genuine global problem.

Secondly, this issue conflicts with the fundamental problem of food supply, which is seriously compromised by limited natural resources as compared with the growth in the world population and the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. The bulk of food produced nowadays could, in fact, be reused for food purposes rather than being disposed of like any other refuse, with a major impact in environmental and economic terms as well as ethical implications.

Combating food waste must therefore become a priority on Europe’s policy agenda: the Commission, Council and Member States must draw up practical strategies and measures to halve it along the entire supply chain by 2025, to improve the efficiency of the industry, and to raise the public’s awareness of an issue that is unknown in many respects.

People must be informed not only about the causes and effects of waste, but also about ways of reducing it: a scientific and civic culture guided by the principles of sustainability and solidarity must be fostered so as to encourage better behaviour.</literal>

               –I voted in favour of the Caronna report because I totally agree with the idea that the European Union should send out a strong signal against food wastage.

Food waste jars not only with the hunger suffered by many populations around the world, but also with our limited natural resources. Designating 2013 the European Year against Food Waste is, I think, a commendable initiative by the European institutions. Considering that most of the waste occurs at the distribution and consumption stages, such a declaration would play a key role in raising interest in this issue among the peoples of Europe.</literal>

Observing, at the same time, that 79 million citizens are living below the poverty line and 16 million are dependent on charities for food aid, we wish to see measures to reduce food wastage taken at a European level.

               –Half of edible food in the EU is wasted. Every year, each EU citizen generates 179 kg of food waste, and it is estimated that this figure could increase by 40% by 2020.

The report sets out concrete measures for halving this wastage by 2025. These measures include dual-date labelling, with ‘sell by’ and ‘use by’ dates, modifying the size of packaging to better match quantities, the possibility of bulk sales, discounted sales of products that are damaged or close to their expiry date, awareness-raising campaigns and education initiatives at the various levels of education. It also calls for changes to the public procurement rules for catering and hospitality services, so that businesses that redistribute any unsold items to disadvantaged citizens free of charge are given preference.

The report introduces measures that reduce food waste and increase the efficiency of the food chain, so I voted in favour.

In the EU, there are 16 million people who receive food aid. I believe that this situation should be resolved as a matter of priority.

               –Food wastage has reached enormous proportions today, and should therefore be viewed as a global problem. It can be considered to be present throughout the entire food chain, from the producers to the consumers. According to estimates, more than half of our healthy and edible foodstuffs is wasted. The issue of food wastage contradicts the fundamental problem of food security, because the world’s population is steadily growing and with it, the access of the poorest strata of society to food is becoming increasingly limited, not to mention that the superfluous production of foodstuffs that are not consumed entails high environmental costs. The reasons behind wasteful behaviour, however, are not the same in every case. Whilst, in industrialised countries, the issue is chiefly concentrated around marketing and consumption due to the abundance of foodstuffs produced, in developing countries, it is caused by a lack of advanced agricultural procedures and safe storage options. These data clearly show that the amounts of food produced today should be reused for food purposes instead of simply being discarded like any other waste. The fight against food wastage should become a priority item on the agenda of European politics. A concrete strategy needs to be elaborated in order to cut food wastage in half across the entire food supply chain by 2025. I consider it extremely important to inform citizens not only about the reasons and consequences of wastage, but also about the methods of its reduction. I supported the report with my vote.</literal>

In this connection, laudable initiatives have already been started in some countries, whereby food which would otherwise be discarded by shops is distributed to social centres. While, in high-tech countries, there is wastage at the processing and consumption stages, developing countries need to work on efficient transport and improved storage facilities for agricultural produce.

Recent investigations have shown that in Europe, the amount of healthy, edible food that is lost along the entire food supply chain stands at around 50%, a figure that is quite frankly unacceptable. The world population is continuing to grow and, in the coming years, the global food supply challenge needs to be tackled and solved. It is therefore only right that we should begin not to waste what we already have at our disposal. In addition to causing economic harm to producers and consumers, the wastage of food also has a significant impact from a social point of view, and that is why the actions should be encouraged to support the collection and recovery at local level of unsold or discarded but perfectly usable products, so that they may, for example, be redistributed to the needy. The European Union must be the standard-bearer for best practices in this area, and ensure that they develop throughout Europe: EU institutions themselves should lead by example, pledging to reduce waste in staff canteens.</literal>

As living standards rise, we enjoy increasing choice and the availability of food products with aesthetic appearance, but we devote less and less thought to the sensible use of food. This is especially the case when the true extent of food wastage is invisible to the ordinary consumer, because the most extensive component of this wastage takes place during the phase in which food is produced and transported. In addition, consumers have become increasingly demanding regarding the appearance of food, and much food that is perfectly suitable for consumption is discarded solely due to its unsuitable appearance. There is also no reason why food that is approaching its expiry date should not be sold to consumers who are willing to purchase it for a lower price or even distributed as free food aid. Methods for the avoidance of food wastage are simple and readily available (purchasing the correct quantity of food, purchasing food produced by the producer who is nearest to the consumer, the proper storage of food, etc.), but these must also become ingrained among as many consumers as possible and be implemented among producers, suppliers and sellers of food.</literal>

               –Food wastage in the world has increased by 50% over the last 35 years. At the same time, the percentage of destitute persons in the EU, especially in the countries that have been hit by the fiscal crisis, has increased significantly. Europe must manage its resources more efficiently. It is important to note that, according to a recent study, Europeans and North Americans waste, on average, between 95 and 115 kilograms of food a year, as opposed to between six and 11 kilograms in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, most wastage is concentrated in the final stages of distribution and consumption, owing, above all, to the overabundance of food produced, whereas in developing countries, it is concentrated at the early stages, owing to the lack of advanced agricultural practices, effective transport systems, infrastructures and so on. More efficient management of food will guarantee more efficient distribution of it and food for those who do not have it. I therefore endorse the European Parliament’s call on the Council, the Commission and the Member States, especially in the midst of the economic crisis, to adopt strategies in this direction and to propose that 2013 be declared the European Year against Food Waste, which is why I voted in favour of this particular report.</literal>

In a context of European-level crisis, where the waste of resources is inadmissible, and with the exponential growth of developing countries, which have new and increased food needs, as well as climate change, which are causing irreversible crop losses, the problem tackled in this report should be a priority for the EU.

Too often, this wastage involves perfectly edible food, which is in no way waste; rather, it is discarded from the food chain for aesthetic reasons or, frequently, owing to the nearness of the ‘use by’ date. This is why I support the idea of promoting the primary sector and low food miles in the future common agricultural policy.

Food wastage can be seen at every stage in the chain, from harvest to consumption. The environmental impact of these failures is exacerbated and has knock-on effects on fisheries and energy resources as well as on waste management.

               –The problem of food wastage is becoming increasingly serious. According to the European Commission’s data, the annual generation of food waste in the 27 Member States amounts to over 89 million tonnes, or 179 kilograms per capita. On average, 20-30% of food purchased in European households is thrown away, two-thirds of which is still edible. Moreover, if we do not undertake decisive steps and measures, by 2020, the total amount of wasted food will have risen to around 126 million tonnes. The implications of food wastage itself are not only of an ethical, economic, social and nutritional nature. Food wastage also has consequences for health and the environment, since food waste contributes to global warming. In agriculture, cases of food wastage occur both during the production process as well as in the storage of agricultural goods. In the food industry, food is often already being wasted during the collection of raw materials, as well as during transport, when it is carried over thousands of kilometres. However, the problem is most acute in the case of households. Excessive purchases, elapsed expiry dates and the lack of proper management skills in relation to foodstuffs result in food ending up in the bin. Therefore, the Member States should adopt common strategies to combat this problem, starting with the exchange of good practice.</literal>

               –According to several studies, food waste around the world has risen by 50% since 1974. The production of surplus food that we do not consume has a high environmental cost, deriving from the use of energy and natural resources, as well as from gas emissions into the atmosphere.

The aim of this vote is to combat such a trend by reiterating the importance of spreading an anti-waste culture across the Member States, which must become one of the priorities on the European agenda.

Citizens need to be informed not only of the causes and effects of waste, but also of ways to reduce it. A scientific and civic culture guided by the principles of sustainability and solidarity must be fostered so as to encourage better behaviour, particularly by supporting spontaneous initiatives taken by associations that publicise an anti-waste culture.</literal>

We must already adopt at EU level all the measures necessary to tackle in the future the rise in the world population and, by extension, the issue of supplying them with the food they need.

In view of this, I am voting for this report, as I believe there is a need to carry out a thorough analysis of the whole food supply chain in order to identify which food sectors generate the most waste, and to establish common food-related objectives at international level with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in order to facilitate the application of discounts to products nearing their expiry date. I also believe that increased exchange of best practices should be promoted, and that campaigns should be carried out to raise public awareness of the value of food and agricultural products.</literal>

We call on the Council, the Commission, Member States and players in the food supply chain to address as a matter of urgency the problem of food waste along the entire supply and consumption chain and to devise guidelines and forms of support with a view to improving the efficiency of the food supply chain sector by sector. There are different reasons for food waste: overproduction, faulty product targeting (unadapted size or shape), deterioration of the products or their packaging, marketing rules (problems of appearance or defective packaging), or inadequate stock management and marketing strategies. We urge the Commission to assess the impact of a policy of enforcement with regard to food waste, aimed at all the stakeholders in the food chain, by applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle. We call on the Commission to create specific food waste prevention targets for Member States, as part of the waste prevention targets to be met by Member States by 2014, as recommended by the 2008 Waste Framework Directive.</literal>

A staggering 50% of edible food is wasted each year, even though 79 million EU citizens live beneath the poverty line. We need an effective EU-wide strategy to tackle the issue of food wastage. I believe that new awareness campaigns would help inform people on how best to avoid food wastage and to use food sustainably. Schools and colleges could explain the need for effective cooking, storing and disposal of foodstuffs, which could help reduce the amount currently being thrown away. I also echo calls to make labelling on food packages clearer, so that both ‘use by’ dates and ‘sell by’ dates are displayed – this would help consumers make a more informed decision when purchasing food. In addition, the use of local produce should be promoted in catering and hospitality and the redistribution of food to poorer people free of charge should be encouraged.</literal>

I can therefore only support the call for 2013 to be declared the European Year against Food Waste, with information and educational initiatives. We need citizens to be more aware, right from childhood onwards. We need to explain to our citizens what the ‘best before’ date means. The ‘best before’ date is not an expiry date. Consumers should use it only as a guide. The ‘use by’ date for perishable goods is different. These products should not be consumed after such a date. We all have a responsibility to prevent food waste across Europe and to create greater understanding.</literal>

It calls on the Commission and the Member States to implement specific measures to halve food waste by 2025, to improve the efficiency of the food industry and, in particular, to increase public awareness of this issue. We all have to do our bit here. The figures are alarming: in Germany alone, an estimated 20 million tonnes of food ends up being thrown away every year. Moreover, this is mainly happening right at the end of the food chain – in other words, it is being done by us, the consumers. Quite apart from the ethical issues of how we can allow this to happen when so many people do not have even the bare minimum, it also gives rise to environmental pollution and costs of disposal. We therefore all need to take a more sustainable attitude to food, and we politicians should impose fewer regulations on the food industry that only aggravate the problem. The German organisationprovides an example of a sensible option for reusing food that can no longer be sold. In Saxony alone, there are 35, or table, charities; in Germany as a whole, there are around 900. Over 100 000 tonnes of food are donated to theorganisations in Germany annually – unfortunately, that still leaves a lot of the 20 million tonnes going to waste.</literal>

               – In my constituency of London, enough food to fill nearly 12 000 double-decker buses is thrown away every year. London is committed to cutting the amount of food sent to landfill. The London Food Board works hard to raise awareness of waste amongst both individuals and businesses. Household initiatives include residents using a specially provided kitchen caddy to collect food waste which is then sent for composting. Similarly, businesses are being encouraged to sign a ‘Food Waste Pyramid’ which asks them to avoid buying surplus food, redistribute any unwanted food to charities, and pass food unfit for human consumption to livestock. Many supermarkets and cafés in London have systems in place to give food at its ‘sell by’ date to homeless people, which is distributed via local members of the community. Food wastage is a problem for all EU countries. I therefore voted for this report as I believe we can share best practice across the EU on reducing the quantity of food waste that is being dumped into landfill.</literal>

               –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday, 25 Member States faced their responsibilities by agreeing to sign the fiscal treaty.

They decided to fight against the poor budget management which has left us without the necessary room for manoeuvre to stimulate growth and employment. They showed their ability to find European solutions to European problems, even though two Member States decided that they would rather go it alone, which they will live to regret.

I have, at this stage, three wishes. The first is that this treaty be ratified as quickly as possible, the second is that it be applied as quickly as possible and the third is that this agreement be fully integrated into EU law, as Parliament has called for.

Ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis has forced us to rethink our bad habits. It has forced us to respect the rules of balanced budgets, which are obvious, yet so difficult to apply.

We must reduce national deficits, which also often cover up regional and local deficits. However, while the decision on this treaty is the correct decision and a positive one, the decision on growth leaves me rather disappointed. This is because combating deficits and stimulating growth are two sides of the same coin. One without the other will not help Europeans to escape from the difficulties they are facing, particularly the unemployed.

There are two ways of boosting growth: one is artificial and has no future, the other is structural and therefore sustainable. The first is to kick-start the economy through spending. That is what we have been doing for years and look where it has brought us. Never mind the fact that, today, spending is actually limited, as the time has come to repay our debts, and not to borrow.

The second method, the one recommended by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), is to make our economy more competitive. This could already be done, Mr Barroso, by finally completing the internal market. All the laws, all the texts were adopted long ago. The problem, once again, is that they have not been applied. I therefore call on the Commission to let us know as soon as possible which countries are not applying these rules and to fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties by placing restrictions on those which do not apply them – perhaps even France, my friend, as I make no exceptions. All Europeans should know which States are playing the internal market game, and which States are slowing it down or standing in its way.

Increasing our competitiveness could also be achieved by reducing the charges that weigh heavily on entrepreneurs and by reducing the considerable discrepancies in charges between our countries, which harm competitiveness. This could also be done by getting as good a return as possible from European Funds that have been allocated to the States but have not yet been used. The time has come to make the best use of this – considerable – surplus by investing it in common projects to create growth and employment.

Finally, growth and job creation can be encouraged by turning public funds, which are not bringing in investments, towards research and innovation, or towards training. With a quarter of young people looking for a job, we must offer them the chance to acquire strong skills and to redirect them anywhere in the EU.</literal>

               . –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been made clear today in the media that the unemployment rate in the euro area has reached its highest level for 13 years. What is the Council offering us? A Treaty outside the normal community method with the wrong objective and with no certainty as to whether it will ever come into force. The divisions and the uproar within the European Union are continuing.

This is highlighted by the fact that someone came up with the crazy idea of appointing an EU commissioner or a national commissioner for Greece who would undermine Greek democratic institutions. My group is strongly opposed to the appointment of a commissioner who would weaken democracy and make decisions on behalf of the citizens of Greece. We need to make this clear.

However, the situation is also a consequence of the way in which Ms Merkel has misunderstood the leadership role played by Germany. I am in favour of Germany playing a leading role because it is a large and powerful country both in political and economic terms. However, this should involve bringing the EU together and not introducing further divisions. As the Handelsblatt, which really is not a left-wing newspaper, said: ‘The German way does not currently lead towards Europe, but it should do!’

I would like to give Ms Merkel one piece of advice. She should start looking around for a new partner, because the future President of France is François Hollande. We support the future president and we are particularly in favour of his intention to renegotiate this Treaty. Mr Sarkozy’s election campaign appearances are no longer helping him and are only causing further harm to Ms Merkel. We need a change of direction here.

However, the content is also causing problems. We only need to look at the most recent developments in Portugal. These Council resolutions are not helping to increase stability in the countries which are in difficulty or in the markets. We need to move money from the financial markets into the real economy, primarily by means of a financial transaction tax. We must give the European Investment Bank more opportunities for lending. We must also make more money available to people in the lower income brackets. They need the money and they would also be prepared to spend it. That is the direction we should be moving in.

Mr Van Rompuy, I do not deny that there have also been a few positive developments. You are finally getting to grips with unemployment, in particular among young people. However, can you explain to me why there are binding Treaties and sanctions for the Member States with high budget deficits? When it is a question of youth unemployment, you can only come up with feeble explanations and recommendations. We cannot accept an unbalanced situation of this kind.

Finally, I would like to give my sincere thanks to President Buzek for pushing to ensure that a team from Parliament was involved in the negotiations. I would also like to thank the negotiators. They have been able to prevent a few serious mistakes from being made. Above all, however, I would like to thank President Schulz. You have found the right words and the appropriate tone to ensure that we in the European Union are heard, as Mr Barroso has said. This will allow us to work together to prevent the mistake that has been made with this Treaty from becoming the general rule. If it is ever accepted and comes into force, it must remain an exception. Against this background, Mr Schulz, some people may be regretting who they voted for. Those people who did not vote for Mr Schulz may be regretting that they did not. A strong voice will enable Parliament to be heard more clearly in future.</literal>

In answer to the other question, I would like to make it quite clear to you that, for me and for my group, youth unemployment is a European issue. We cannot tolerate it. Youth unemployment levels are so high because too much trust has been placed in market forces and no one has thought about the fact that sometimes active measures need to be taken. Look at the countries with low unemployment rates. I invite you to pay a visit to Austria. We have one of the lowest levels of unemployment, because, for us and for my colleagues in the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), unemployment is a disgrace.

               Mr President, the summit on Monday was about jobs and growth, but I must say that, in my opinion – and my assessment is the same as that of my colleague Joseph Daul – it has mainly produced words. Seven pages of words and seven pages of good intentions. I think what we need now in the middle of this crisis is not seven pages of words, but acts – acts of the European Union and acts of the European institutions.

Let me give you just three examples. The first is the European patent. It is a major instrument for growth in Europe, but, for more than a year now, its introduction – which is so needed – has been blocked. Why is it blocked? Because, for the moment, the big countries cannot agree on the seat: that is the reality in Europe for the moment. On the seat! This is completely ridiculous and I should say even tragic, because, in the mean time, our small and medium enterprises are paying eight times more for the protection of their innovations than their American counterparts do. So I ask the President of the Council and the President of the Commission: if Germany, Britain and France really cannot agree, why can the EU leadership not put the seat temporarily in Brussels? Why are they not doing that – as we did, Mr Cohn-Bendit, with the European Food Agency in 2001? I think it is a shame to have a Council summit about growth but not to be capable of definitely launching the European patent in Europe.

Let me give a second example of this, namely the project bonds. How many times have we already discussed the project bonds in this Parliament? We have been discussing them for years. My question is: why do we not start tomorrow with project bonds in the European Union? Why is it necessary to wait for two years of discussion inside the Council and inside other institutions?

Let me give a third example of this, namely the enormous amount of unused money in the structural and other European funds. We could change the regulation immediately. You know what the problem is – if you put in one euro from the structural funds, you also need one euro from the country in question, and these countries, for example Greece and Portugal, cannot do this at the moment. So why is it not possible immediately to change the regulation and immediately to use this unused, unspent money for countries in recession, such as Portugal and Greece? That is what we need today – acts and not words, not the seven pages we have seen up to now.

Finally, I think another problem we have today is the existential problem that we have in this euro crisis. We have now secured a new treaty. We now have fiscal discipline – let us be honest, a six-pack, a two-pack, a new treaty – but how will we now deal with the high interest rates we still have, even after the intervention of the European Central Bank, in countries such as Spain and Italy? Everybody here knows that an interest rate of around 6% is not sustainable for Italy. Whatever decision Mr Monti may take, it is not sustainable and Italy cannot recover with a 6% interest rate.

We have already put more than EUR 1 000 billion into the fight against this crisis – EUR 1 trillion of taxpayers’ money – and the end is not in sight. The reason for this is that we always take half measures. We need a structural solution to this crisis. In my opinion a structural solution means a mutualisation of a part of the debt in a disciplined way.

That is the proposal of the five wise German economists: to create a redemption fund. Let us be clear. My conclusion is a message to the German taxpayers. If the solution we opt for is a redemption fund, it will be the bond holders who receive lower interest rates: they are the solution to the crisis, and not the German taxpayers. So my message today to all of you is: let us take up that proposal of a redemption fund and let us in our legislative work bring it about as fast as possible.</literal>

               . –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the Summit I read in the newspapers that some people had described the Summit and the Fiscal Compact Treaty as a masterpiece. However, when I look at what really happened, my evaluation of it is completely different.

What did happen? We have a Treaty which is still being drafted and we will have to wait and see where it ends up. This is a Treaty which aims to ensure that existing European Union Treaties are complied with, but is positioned outside those Treaties. This new Treaty which lies outside the other treaties has succeeded in completely marginalising democracy.

If that is a masterpiece, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know whether I can still take Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso seriously. I believe that you are much wiser in political terms than the speeches that you have given today about this most recent informal summit and its results might indicate. I would like to say to you that I think this whole thing is a political charade. I do not believe that the citizens of Europe will be very happy about this. I believe that the citizens are increasingly realising that the charade which took place during the Summit is intended to deceive them.

What is the biggest problem? In my opinion, the biggest difficulty is the analysis that lies behind the Fiscal Compact Treaty which cites public debt as being the major problem in the crisis. However hard I try to understand this interpretation of the crisis, I cannot come to the same conclusion. Nevertheless, the fact that we are still only arguing about the restructuring of public budgets has been making the crisis worse over a period of years. Therefore, the subject that should really have been debated is the programme to combat recession in the countries which are in crisis. Where is it? You have been talking today once again about jobs and growth, but, as far as I can see, only passing mention was made of this whole subject at the Summit. I am still able to read and do sums. Where is the money to back up the announcements and promises that you have made, which are sheer invention? I do not know where it is.

Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at Greece and at Portugal, we must all be aware of the risk of infection. What does Greece need now? An austerity commissioner? Another instrument of torture, thought up by European technocrats who have already put in place a technical government, with a financial expert at its head, and now an austerity commissioner? In my opinion, what the Greeks need is an honest analysis at last and an honest commitment to a better future. A programme to combat recession is urgently required. We know that the programmes in the areas of general infrastructure and energy infrastructure had already been completed and we could have introduced them. There were European companies who would have invested in Greece. We are talking about an austerity commissioner instead of discussing with the Greeks what the Greece of tomorrow will look like and instead of giving the Greeks some encouragement. I thought that it was a particularly low point when Greece was discussed as some sort of side issue. Mr Van Rompuy, this Summit made me feel ashamed.

I would like to make one final point. We need to have a private talk about how the countries which have not yet joined the euro are being treated. How can you justify this? I am definitely not Mr Tusk’s closest friend. His political background is quite different to mine. However, when it is all about Europe and about the big picture and not about the narrow-minded interests of those European countries which are still wealthy, when we need to look at the situation as a whole, I think we should take Mr Tusk as our model. The dispute with him about a seat at the children’s table was a low point of European politics. For me a masterpiece is something quite different.</literal>

               Mr President, there seems to be some agreement in the House today that even if this pact is adopted and ratified – which of course is very far from a forgone conclusion if Mr Swoboda is right about what happens in France and other countries – it will do nothing to solve this current crisis. As a fiscal conservative myself, I should be delighted that we are enshrining fiscal discipline and balanced budgets within national laws and constitutions. However, as a democrat, what greatly concerns me is that an electorate’s ability to vote for a high-spending Keynesian economic policy is effectively being removed from them. We are making socialism illegal. This pact is effectively rendering all elections null and void across much of Europe.

Let me say this. As a free market conservative myself who finds much to admire in the German model of fiscal and monetary discipline, we cannot impose our vision by force of law; we must also use force of argument. We need to show that austerity is not forever, that there is light at the end of a tunnel but, as long as we cut off the possibility of a Member State leaving the euro, then we block that tunnel. We condemn many countries to years of deflation, of poverty and of emigration, with no end in sight. Recovery will not come to many of the countries in southern Europe, in my view, until they are free to reissue their own currencies and to price their way back into the market.

Nor of course can we preach austerity to them unless we practise it ourselves. Imagine how a European summit – with its banquets, its motorcycle outriders, the armies of hangers on – must look to a public sector worker who is facing redundancy because of government cutbacks. Imagine how taxpayers in our home countries feel when every pound or euro saved in domestic spending is swallowed up by higher contributions to the EU budget.

My group makes no apologies for being single-minded about the single market. We will continue to pursue this agenda of creating the single market, of further extending services and reviewing procurement rules to encourage innovation. We will continue to push for better implementation of existing single market rules. And of course opening the single market would be pointless unless we continue to open our markets to the rest of the world; the parts of the world, that is, where there is still growth happening.

But many of these actions are in the medium and the long term. There is one action, however, that we could take right here right now to show businesses our commitment to growth. Surely one of the best ways for the EU to speed up growth is to scrap the Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs in the Commission and repatriate its responsibilities to national governments. Then we could scrap the Working Time Directive, the Agency Workers Directive, the Pregnant Workers Directive and all of the other barriers to actually employing people if we really want to create jobs in Europe. We cannot create those jobs by talking about them; by passing resolutions. In fact, we Eurocrats and MEPs cannot actually create any jobs at all. What we can do is get out of the way and allow entrepreneurs to invent things, to make things and to sell things. That is where employment growth comes from and it is also where social security comes from.

When I was a new MEP we had something called the Lisbon Agenda. It was supposed to make Europe the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. As Sarah Palin might have put it, ‘how is that working out for you?’</literal>

               . –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the financial markets has led to developments on the markets that have not yet been brought under control. Only radical measures to prevent speculation on the markets will be able to put a definitive stop to the crisis.

Instead of this, with the adoption of the Fiscal Compact Treaty we are seeing a further increase in the one-sided focus on austerity policy and the destruction of social cohesion. My group is strongly opposed to this radical approach of debt reduction and cuts in public budgets. It has even been criticised by the International Monetary Fund.

The financial guru George Soros says that this austerity policy has thrown Europe into a deflationary spiral of debt. The debt brake was laid down in the Treaty of Maastricht and its adoption in national law is now intended to force its implementation. If that does not happen, the Member States are to be penalised with the help of the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union. That is absurd, and it is also undemocratic, as the Member States will lose their most important right: their budgetary sovereignty.

Furthermore, it is totally unacceptable for the aid that is used to show solidarity with Member States which are in difficulty to be made conditional on signing up to the Fiscal Compact Treaty. This sacrifices the most important fundamental principle of the European Union on the altar of the financial markets.

The Left will work to bring about a reversal of this disastrous policy. We need a pact for sustainable growth and employment. We need public programmes for investment in the environment and education and, above all, we need the European Parliament and the citizens to have a say. The Treaty must be approved by referendum or by public consultation.</literal>

               Mr President, first of all I would like to say: congratulations everybody! David Cameron had you worried for a bit, you even thought he was a Eurosceptic, but it is OK. You have had a quiet word with him and the real David Cameron is back. Whatever happened to the veto? No more vetoes any more. Indeed, Mr Cameron is now actively supporting this quite despicable pact, this plan to destroy and humiliate nation states that do not live up to a Germanic view of how economies ought to be run.

I must say I thought the weekend’s proposals from the German finance ministry suggesting that a European Commissioner and his staff occupy a big building in Athens and take over the running of the country – a Gauleiter, some might say – must be joke. Even this EU, I thought, could not possibly sink to those depths – but of course it was just a negotiating position and what we now have for Greece is diplomacy at gunpoint. It is the kind of strategy that Palmerston used against Athens back in the 19th century. Nobody can deny today that Greece is no more than a colony.

And this is all a terrible, huge mistake. Greece is not a failing subsidiary company where head office needs to come in and take control. Greece is a nation with a soul, a nation with pride, with history – goodness me, they invented democracy in the first place. They are suffering. They have youth unemployment of 50% caused, Mr Van Rompuy, because they are in the euro. You are causing the misery in these countries and you blather on about creating jobs and growth. None of this is actually going to happen.

And remember, these people are being driven into humiliation and desperation. Desperate people do desperate things, and I am deeply fearful for what will happen in Greece if we continue with this mad course. And of course, as Mr Barroso knows, it is going to be Portugal next.</literal>

  Mr President, Mr Cameron said that he will not prevent EU institutions from being used to enforce the intergovernmental agreement on fiscal policy. It would appear that he is promising to refrain from doing something that he cannot completely prevent and in some areas would not need to prevent.

Article 8 of the draft agreement states that it will use Article 273 of the TFEU to enforce the agreement. It is true that Article 273 does say that ‘the Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction in any dispute between Member States which relates to the subject matter of the Treaties if the dispute is submitted to it under a special agreement’. However, whilst it can adjudicate on such agreements, it probably does not have the power to fine Member States for not complying with them. Furthermore, its jurisdiction does not extend to adjudicating on excessive budget deficits.

Article 8 of the draft agreement does say that the Commission can initiate any action, but I am afraid that the draft agreement is not a treaty and so cannot grant that power. Article 273 of the Treaty refers only to disputes between Member States and not to disputes with the Commission. It would appear therefore that the Commission does not have the power to initiate any action. In fact, it would appear that the Commission will have no role in this draft agreement at all. The Court of Justice will be able to say whether or not a country has broken the agreement but it will not be able to compel an erring country to obey.

If euro area countries want an agreement that can be enforced, they will need a new treaty which will have to be agreed unanimously. In my view it would be disastrous for Britain to agree to such a mechanism because it might be used today to enslave euro area countries but one day it will be used to enslave us.</literal>

  –Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would like to start by thanking Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy and his staff for having cooperated so successfully with the negotiating team from the European Parliament.

Secondly, I have to say that we did not want this Treaty. We wanted a Community-based Treaty. However, this was not possible on account of the position of the United Kingdom, because it imposed the condition that we must not regulate the financial markets. We want to regulate the financial markets so that this casino does not destroy us, and that is why we had to reject the demands of the United Kingdom.

The language of the past is now coming from certain circles. This European Union has brought peace, freedom and prosperity to the people as never before in the history of this continent, and I will not allow the hatred of Mr Farage and others who have spoken here to destroy that.

This Treaty makes the debt brake, the reverse qualified majority and the Court of Justice of the European Union possible. These are not possible with the current Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. However, we ought to ensure that everything else falls within the framework of Community legislation, and we have managed this with a great deal of support. Community rules should apply and everything should be done within the framework of Community legislation, taking into account the European Parliament’s power of codecision. Mr Barroso, we ask you now to put forward proposals in this regard very quickly, and not just the two-pack, but also in other areas and in relation to the implementation of the growth package, so that we can do something tangible.

Greece and other countries need a light at the end of the tunnel. In reality, citizens need to see that the dredgers are operating and working for the future. We need fiscal discipline. We need structural changes in these countries in order to remove barriers to competition – these are mostly to do with national legislation. However, we also need to utilise the possibilities afforded by European instruments. When I see EUR 16 billion sitting in the account for Greece, but the Greek administration is not able to submit projects for this, then we need to help it. That is what is coming now, Mr Swoboda. We need to help Greece to take control of its administration so that it can generate growth. That is what it is all about. Chancellor Merkel is fighting for discipline, structural changes and growth. These are the three pillars. If we forget discipline we will destroy the future of subsequent generations. That, too, needs to be viewed in this context.

The Community method and the rights of the European Parliament are being maintained here. However, I believe that we need twice as much solidarity as Ms Merkel wants. Everyone is trying to put his house in order, and on this basis we will provide assistance. That is what this strategy is all about. The socialists should now please vote for Mr Sarkozy, as he has now proposed a financial transaction act. We should give this our support. François Mitterrand needed two years to abandon socialism because France was bankrupt. If François Hollande were to be elected – which I hope does not happen – he would have 14 days in which to change his views, from the day of the election to the day he takes office, otherwise France would be ruined.</literal>

Now, to get to the point, does Mr Brok personally, and on behalf of his group, believe that it is normal for a country to be subjected to wardship without the population of that country being consulted in a referendum?

Furthermore, does he think it normal that Eurobonds may potentially be introduced without allowing your countrymen, the Germans, or the Dutch to vote or to choose whether that is what they want? It is clear that the boundary of what can be done within the limits of democracy has been exceeded.

I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Brok, do you not also think that the Greeks - and the Germans and the Dutch – should be allowed a voice, to establish via a referendum how they see the future of Europe?</literal>

If we accept rules, sign treaties and lay down legislation, we must ensure that these are applied. That is all we are talking about.

Secondly, all the measures that are now being decided on will only be taken as a result of decisions by the national parliaments, the parliaments in Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, but not the United Kingdom, because it is not involved in the solidarity measures for Greece. That needs to be said in this connection – also on account of your concerns about ordinary citizens, Mr Farage.

I believe, for that reason, we could only have such a Commissioner for austerity if there were a common set of rules with a legal basis which applied to all countries that did not comply with the rules. I therefore strongly reject the idea – and that is the position of the German Government – that there can be no special solution for Greece in this regard.</literal>

  Mr President, the statement on growth and jobs agreed on Monday finally calls for ‘smart fiscal consolidation preserving investment in future growth, sound macroeconomic policies and an active employment strategy preserving social cohesion’. That is exactly what my group has been calling for since the start of the crisis.

The problem is that you have already made the choice of a, rather than a, approach to fiscal consolidation. That dumb approach is embodied in the so-called six-pack and it is made even worse by this new international treaty. That framework prevents us from ‘preserving investment in future growth’ as the conclusion said.

If you really want to be smart, you can do much more. The Council could join this Parliament in seeking to put in place a real system of Eurobonds that would lower our interest rates on public debt and create room for manoeuvre for new investment. What is more, the Council could agree a more ambitious financial transactions tax, as we proposed, to generate up to EUR 200 billion of annual revenue. That would be smart. All that we can hope is that the inverse relationship between the Council’s use of the language of ‘smartness’ and the state of our economies will lead to a breakthrough soon for a true smart response to the crisis.

Finally, a word on Mr Callanan’s speech: he claims to deplore the fact that this treaty would make socialism illegal, but then he goes on to say that he would scrap all of the fruits of socialism. I would like to thank him for putting so clearly on the record the Conservative position.</literal>

  Mr President, jobs and growth have made it to the top of the agenda and action needs to follow. The other issue that has made the top of the agenda is the crisis for youth, but it is more than the fact that we just have devastatingly high numbers of young jobless. The ECB liquidity operations may have lifted the mood, but we should not be deceived. Potentially 2 trillion plus being sucked up by the banking system by next June should tell us that some kind of transfer already is going on. The question is: will this generation face up to it or foist it, along with joblessness, on to the younger generation? They face no jobs, no home ownership, and a financial system stuffed with the bonds of this generation’s failure.

And for those who try to lay the blame on the EBA for its bank stress tests, I would like to remind Member States that the deal was a combination of stress tests and firewall, and it is the constant delay in the firewalls that has made matters worse – among, of course, a few other delays.</literal>

  Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome the fiscal compact. In fact it comes 10 years too late. A monetary union needs budgetary underpinning, without which it will crumble.

But the long-term objective does not solve short-term problems. Greece will not recover in the euro area, Portugal is a cliff-hanger, and Italy, Spain and France lost their competitiveness years ago, partly because of the euro. Transfers will not cure the loss of competitiveness. Nor will increased taxation, as Mr Sarkozy thinks. Every time he appears on television he proposes a new tax. I wonder why French socialists still need a presidential candidate because Mr Sarkozy is turning socialist by the day.

Now we also have a Brussels-based budget tsar. Mr Rehn is from a country that once lived under tsarist rule. He knows all about it, but in the end Moscow never succeeded in imposing policies on neighbouring states like the one of budget tsar Mr Rehn.

If there are countries that have problems with their economy, impose a fine on them and – hey presto – that will solve the problem! Why could we not have thought of this a little sooner? It is so simple and so effective. Why not use this method to solve other problems? For example, a country that has far too high a rate of unemployment could simply receive a fine. Or what about a country that has too many poor people, what should we do about that? Combat poverty with fines! The Heads of State or Government did not want to go that far, however. Millions of people in the EU are poor and out of work. That may be acceptable without imposing fines, but if a country chooses to carry out massive public investment, for example by taking out loans to create green jobs in the solar, wind and wave energy sectors, thereby creating employment, the EU’s hammer falls. I am sorry, but is this not a very blinkered economic policy? I am very well aware that the summit was met with a general strike by Belgian workers. This is something we will see more and more often if this policy continues.</literal>

As long as we have problems in Greece, we will have problems in Europe. We call on all of you to stop focussing on Greece, because we will do our job and we call on our German colleagues, because a divide is already emerging which has a name and a face: the face of Germany.

Once again, nothing was decided. Vague plans were forged to limit youth unemployment in the euro area, while Greece was not even on the agenda.

Mr President, when will Greece leave the single currency? Even a 70% haircut will not bring its sovereign debt below 120% by 2020. You know that, I know that and all independent economists know it too. You are playing poker with taxpayers’ money, liars’ poker.

Then we have budgetary discipline – seemingly the magic word for 2012. Mr President, you also know, however, that a dramatically shrinking economy does not enable any rabbits to be pulled from hats. Mr Barroso, how can you defend tampering with the measly Portuguese pension of EUR 200 a month? It does not even make a difference, given the fact that Portuguese interest rates yesterday rose to a record high.

The markets do not believe in it. It is like asking whether water can burn. There is no chance, Mr President. Currently, 23 million Europeans are unemployed. In southern Europe, we will soon have a situation where more than half of under-25s are jobless. I thought that the EU promised to ensure people’s prosperity. Instead of that, the EU is providing us with a nightmare.

Incidentally, what we have now achieved is along the same lines as what we decided six months ago in connection with the six-pack. I really cannot understand all the agitation here.

Our colleagues were involved in trying to improve on many aspects of the best solution and to bring it into line with Community law, as Mr Brok has just mentioned. Then we see such a display here from the chairs of the large groups, who are playing the worst form of party politics.

I regret it because it is inefficient in its response to the market in the face of the crisis as it does not rebuild confidence. We have seen the problems Greece and Portugal have had in the same period. We are seeing two countries, who are the greatest contributors to our budget, France and Germany, whose growth rates have been halved. We understand that it is the wording of this treaty which, normally, should have served to settle things and reassure everyone, including the people. In reality, it is the action of the ECB which has had a positive effect, by making over EUR 500 billion of liquidities available to the banks.

However, in Parliament, we must realise that we have to be consistent. We are elected by our voters; and our voters are the retired people who are in debt, the workers who marched through the streets of Brussels, the unemployed people waiting for work, and the young people who want to have a future. We cannot content ourselves with criticising a treaty which is based solely on fiscal discipline, on penalties, and which, even worse, introduces government by the judiciary to the detriment of the sovereignty of national parliaments. We, the Members of the European Parliament, should rise up against this outcome and put forward proposals.

I, for one, have proposals that I should like to put forward. This is not simply about criticising. I believe, Mr President, that what we can propose today for Europe is a virtuous circle, a European pact of responsibility, governance and growth. This treaty must be renegotiated, on a basis which allows for true coordination of economic policies, including industrial projects to provide work for our factories and our workers, projects in the fields of energy and the environment, the creation of Eurobonds, which have regrettably been forgotten about or crossed off the agenda, and financial regulation.

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the President of the Parliament for the manner in which on this occasion he defended not only the powers of our Assembly but also the democratic nature of the decision-making process in the European institutions, thus underpinning the outstanding work of Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri.

Commissioner, the European strategy for growth is contained in those references in the Council results, which, as is appropriate, refer to proposals that the European Commission will be making. We wish to support the Commission in its efforts. Please therefore innovate the decision-making process, opening up not only downstream but also upstream of this process to the contribution of parliamentary committees. By doing so, we will make the process not only more transparent but also more efficient.

President of the Council, in the Chamber today you listened to the dull and gloomy echoes of nationalism which forgets that 65 years of peace and development for Europe are the exception, not the rule in our history. Please help us to make sure that this is fully understood by those Heads of State or Government tempted to give greater credence to the consensus of fickle public opinion than to the sense and beauty of the European project.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, commenting on the rather forgettable conclusions of the summit on 9 December, we said that this Parliament would watch and work to limit the damage of that unfortunate choice.

This has been the case. Parliament’s united commitment in the difficult negotiations that have taken place has definitely helped to prevent even worse developments. There was a real risk that the new treaty would seriously undermine the law and the common European institutions, by establishing standards, mechanisms and procedures external to the Union and in contradiction with its laws.

That is no longer the case. Parliament, the Commission and the President of the European Council have averted this danger. Now the treaty will have to be implemented through EU legislation. The parameters for defining deficit and debt levels have been substantially, although not completely, brought back into the context of the current regulatory framework, and the dreadful possibility of having a new parliamentary institution has been averted.

But even though we have significantly limited the damage, the fiscal compact is not an adequate response to the crisis. There are still unacceptable and unwise aspects, such as the limitations on the presence of Parliament at Euro summits. From a legal perspective, the Court’s power to impose sanctions seems highly dubious. Only if the proposals that Parliament put forward with one voice in its resolution – financial transactions tax, project bonds, stability bonds – are finally adopted, can Europe overcome a crisis that unidirectional fiscal discipline threatens to aggravate.</literal>

  –Mr President, I wanted to bring the support of the French delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, as well as for the main conclusions reached by the Council. Let us not be mistaken. This treaty represents an important step in favour of greater economic and fiscal integration, and in favour of greater financial stability. Let us say it again. We cannot sustainably stimulate growth and employment without cleaning up our public finances. Of course, growth cannot be decreed; this is not a treaty which can stimulate growth on its own. However, a treaty, that is, a collection of rules and mutual commitments, can bring confidence and greater awareness of responsibilities.

Since the Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament thought it appropriate to introduce politicking into this Chamber by alluding to the upcoming French presidential campaign and mentioning the socialist candidate to this French presidential election, I wanted to respond. We in the PPE Group consider the declarations made by the French socialist candidate, who stated that he wanted to renegotiate the treaty concluded by 25 Member States, completely irresponsible. Renegotiate what and with whom? Such statements are totally irresponsible. They have little regard for the word of the French State and show no respect for its commitments.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us take a quick look at the harsh economic reality. On the day of the summit, the markets rated Portuguese debt securities for 10-year bonds at 17% interest and for five-year bonds at 20% interest. So much for the question as to the extent to which the summit has helped to calm the economic situation, or the question of to what degree the new intergovernmental treaty has pacified activity on the market.

If anyone asks himself where the disquiet is coming from, then perhaps the answer is from the economic data and from the feeling that what we have done is not enough. President Schulz, I would like to thank you expressly for the courage and clarity with which you participated in this summit on behalf of this House in order to say that we will indeed defend the Community method and we certainly want consolidation, but we also need to invest so that Europe’s economies can flourish.

I believe that this is a line that this House will be able to agree on, and we will be able to continue to develop a common economic policy.</literal>

  Mr President, let me mention one added value which we should exploit while looking at the implementation of the fiscal pact.

Our economic policies are facing credibility tests by financial markets and we have to act in a spirit of unity and solidarity with the Union and avoid unnecessary divisions. Those who are macro-financially healthier should provide credibility to those who are macro-financially weaker.

That leads me to two conclusions. First, we should share credibility via mutualisation of debt – being an added value added – in exchange for executable deficit and debt rigours. Second, given that 12 of the 17 euro area Member States exceed the golden limit of a 60% debt/GDP ratio, while only one of the eight future members of the euro area – non-euro area today – exceeds that limit, one could say that those healthier non-euro area countries provide credibility to the present members of the euro area, and not the other way round. It would be another added value for the euro area, and it would be in its interest, as a rule, to allow those countries to join euro area summits.</literal>

  –Mr President, I might say that this treaty is useless. Unfortunately, it is above all dangerous. First and foremost, this is because it reinforces a prescription that does not work, with further punishments and stringent rules. The spiral of recession has started. Who could trust a doctor who cannot tell the difference between weight loss and anorexia? A doctor who, however weak the patient becomes, insists on applying a cure, while openly talking about the likelihood of the patient’s death? How many more countries have to go into recession for the Commission and the Council to realise that their diagnosis is wrong and, what is more, dangerous? Here we are representing the European public. There are 23.7 million Europeans unemployed. Almost 6 million young people have no hope of finding a job. Do the Council and the Commission not see that ignoring this fact and failing to give an adequate response reveal an insensitivity that is politically explosive?

Let us be clear. The great recession is not an inevitability, it is an ideological obsession. There is an alternative, but this must take the form of action, rather than words. Where are the project bonds to finance European investment? Where is the tax on speculative financial products, aimed at strengthening the European budget? Where is the barrier that should be protecting countries from the ruinous interest rates imposed on them by the markets, leading to their ruin?

The public demand options – proper options – rather than words.</literal>

  –Mr President, the summit could be seen as a positive summit for development and job creation, but only at the theoretical level. Four years after the start of the crisis, there is still no definite exit strategy for Europe as a whole. The stability pact, as we all know, was not really necessary at the legal level, but was obviously needed as a lesson in discipline and/or as a threat to those who deviate from the rules. We should therefore accept that this is the solution, as all the other potential solutions will be worse for the strong Member States of the Union. The recession alone will not throw up a solution to the problem in any country, especially not mine. Fiscal prudence and the austerity programme are absolutely necessary but, without growth, they are a no-win policy that will have disastrous consequences both on the countries to which they are applied and to Europe as a whole.</literal>

  –Mr President, I am glad that the choice for the central topic of the informal summit fell on economic growth and job creation. However, we cannot evade the fact that the process of harmonising an unsuitably prepared intergovernmental pact with Community law has been underway since December.

Let us be frank: it is no coincidence that several Members believe that this new draft intergovernmental agreement is unnecessary and contains nothing new compared to the six-pack adopted earlier. Although I do not share their opinion, I find it extremely regrettable that this content could not be incorporated already into the six-pack.

At the same time, I would like to stress that any agreement that facilitates common economic governance and urges common European action is an important one; not only on the level of words but also backed by deeds. Still, I am not fully satisfied because common action cannot be realised, as on the one hand, the pact was unfortunately not signed by everyone, and on the other hand, Member States from outside the euro area will not be invited to both events of the summit.

Of course all is well that ends well, and I am happy that the signing will bring the pact to a conclusion, and I hope that the time until the end of March will be sufficient to remedy any shortcomings.</literal>

The future belongs to young people and they are the main beneficiaries of everything that is being built today, good or bad. For this reason, it is imperative that we take measures to improve their situation, both at EU and individual Member State level.

I believe that a basic tool to achieve the objectives proposed in this regard is the cohesion policy.

Mr Draghi said two weeks ago in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that you can have fiscal rectitude without growth but you cannot have growth without fiscal rectitude. I support that. I think that is a fair definition, but please, more emphasis, more leadership, on growth.

As part of this we surely need some new definition of what the market economy is meant to stand for. We are in a situation, it appears to me, where the private sector is regulating the public sector and there is very little accountability. Oligarchs seem to be in charge of certain parts of the markets, so please, let us have more attention to what the markets are doing to the public sector and to us as parliaments and governments, and let us do more to give leadership, to try and bring about growth and jobs.</literal>

  Mr President, like many of us in the House, I am somewhat torn. On the one hand, I can appreciate that the majority of European decision-makers recognise the need for immediate action in order to handle the crisis, which I agree is no longer solely economic.

On the other hand, I am convinced that our point of departure is not the proper one. Of course we cannot do without financial stability and strict rules but, in my opinion, the root of the problem is that there has not been enough attention paid to and emphasis on growth, employment and social inclusion. Understandably, the majority of the conservative leaders were too preoccupied with the austerity measures, which was a big mistake.

In addition, I am not convinced about the way in which the crisis is being handled. We should follow the Community method because we cannot let Europe diverge from what it represents – the foundation of European construction, a way of working together, irrespective of the differences between the Member States.

Apart from this, I underline an important point. The European Parliament is the only directly elected body among the institutions. Our President should fully participate in the Euro summits.</literal>

It is surprising – I too am surprised – that the cost of workers was only the fifth-most important of the concerns and difficulties raised by SMEs. Their major concern was the lack of customers, which is a feature of the recession, and in second place was the lack of credit; in other words, another dimension, another problem resulting from the crisis. I therefore do not understand; I confess that I am completely unable to understand.

It was, nonetheless, a summit of sensible and good compromises. As with every compromise, not everyone is happy with it. However, we have been given an instrument thanks to which, by applying greater discipline to public finances, we can revive the economy of the members of the euro area, but also and most importantly we have managed to avoid the appearance of institutions and political decisions which would cause the rise of two unions in Europe.

For it is biased to focus only on the deficit, and for the only stimulus to be the reallocation of resources which are entirely insufficient when it comes to fulfilling the objectives for stimulating growth and creating employment. However, it is also insufficient to use the term ‘fiscal union’ to talk about something that is only budgetary union, budgetary restraint, which, furthermore, is boosted only by sanctions and by no incentives whatsoever. It is also biased because it is side-stepping Parliament and, through an intergovernmental treaty, trying to avoid making the reform needed to turn the European Central Bank into what the European economy needs.

In the European Parliament resolution on the conclusions of this week’s European Council meeting we must show a united front. I believe that we must speak in favour of smart savings and the effective use of EU funds, but it is very important to emphasise that savings alone will not help to overcome the crisis in the EU. We also need to recognise that major belt-tightening in some Member States in recent years has further increased poverty and social exclusion. In some Member States the response to this has been emigration, particularly among young people. In the European Parliament we have to underline that we can only overcome the crisis by boosting economic growth, increasing employment, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises and using other specific measures. Unfortunately, at this week’s European Council meeting the declaration on growth and the creation of new jobs was overshadowed because most attention was focused on institutional matters and disagreements between certain Member States on an international agreement on the Treaty.

There is nothing that resembles a real solution to the crisis, which is becoming ever more severe.

They want to impose and universally apply the policies of the IMF and EU programmes, the disastrous results of which are plain to see in Greece, Portugal and Ireland. They want to set these policies in stone; that is how they think, without realising that they are cheating themselves. Well into the 21st century, they want to curb the peoples’ right to decide their own path freely, turning sovereign countries into veritable protectorates. This path only leads to disaster.

               -The leaders’ meeting was essentially unnecessary. The Fiscal Compact will certainly not get the EU out of the crisis. It may even fall into recession, due to the cuts. Ultimately, on account of the economic downturn, it will then be even harder to pay back debts, and they will become an increasing burden. Moreover, the probable future president of France has now indicated that he wants to modify the Compact further before ratification.

The need to kick start employment growth, however, is still underestimated. Whereas cost-cutting measures are slowly becoming law, the growth and employment initiative has remained in the form of a general challenge. Sweden has also refrained from signing. From a European perspective, such behaviour is extremely unfortunate. The growth initiative is weak. The Fiscal Compact is being adopted outside the framework of European treaties, and without the UK and the Czech Republic.

The European Parliament’s role in negotiations over these matters is minimised. This should be completely changed. Europe must remain unified and stick to democratic principles and existing legal frameworks. Europe must stop thinking in terms of simplistic formulas such as ‘there are debt problems, so let’s make cuts’. No. We must look for resources that can be sensibly invested in economic recovery - unused resources from EU Structural Funds, the tax on financial transactions, a stronger EIB and European bonds. These are the issues that the summits should be addressing. They will be worthless if this does not happen, and the Union does not have much time left.</literal>

The ink was still wet on the fiscal pact concluded at last week’s summit when the crushing statistics were published: there has never been as high an unemployment rate in the countries of the euro area since the introduction of the common currency as at the end of last year. Youth unemployment is reaching particularly distressing levels in Spain and Greece, where almost half of the people below the age of 25 are unable to find jobs.

I am glad that the Council has finally recognised what Socialist Members in the European Parliaments have been stressing for a long time, namely that this situation is untenable, and that Europe’s increasingly serious problems cannot be resolved solely through budgetary austerity measures. Despite the adoption of legislation after legislation and treaty after treaty on the tightening of fiscal rules, recession seems inevitable. Without economic growth deficit reduction cannot be sustained, new jobs cannot be created, the number of unemployed will not decrease but will in fact rise, and there will be a growing sense of hopelessness, accompanied by the proliferation of radical ideals and views.

The Council took the long-awaited first step when it put the issue of employment and in particular youth employment on its agenda. However, the measures that were decided on are insufficient and lack ambition. Immediate decisions and actions, as well as an increased, targeted use of the EU funds offered is needed to ensure that the young people of today do not feel as if they were ‘Europe’s redundant generation.’</literal>

There are three areas you intend to treat as a priority: the promotion of youth employment, the completion of the single European market, as well as an increase in the support to and a reduction of the burdens of the SME sector. Although I believe that these three directions are good, I find the measures they involve belated and incomplete. You still reject the possibility of introducing a transaction tax, even though it has become an economic platitude that the EUR 200 billion it would yield could give new impetus to the European entrepreneurial sector, thereby generating internal consumption for the EU.

The support provided by the new gap-closing, educational and grant programmes will undoubtedly aid the millions of unemployed youths, but as long as we do not ‘sanction’ employers, encouraging them to hire new, young workforce, we cannot expect a breakthrough in this field. The statements made at the Council meeting failed to calm the markets: the 17–20% interest rates on Portuguese government bonds, for instance, saw no decrease whatsoever over the past two days.

As a Member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament I am of the position that the finalisation of the treaties on economic stability and consolidation does not adequately address the EU’s current economic and social issues, and does not serve the purposes of a united Europe.

Although as is often the case in difficult negotiations the agreement is not ideal and does not fully satisfy all the parties, it has however achieved the support of 25 of the European Union’s Member States. This is without doubt an expression of the conviction that Europe does not need disputes, but quite the contrary needs swift and decisive action.

One of the key elements of the negotiations was the question of the participation in Eurosummit meetings by countries which are not part of the euro area. Although the provision which was negotiated introduces certain restrictions in access to these meetings, it was possible, thanks to the enormous determination of the countries from outside the euro area, to defend the institutional system of the EU and not cause a violation of the Community principle. The representatives of the EU institutions – Mr Barroso, Mr Schulz and Mr Van Rompuy – also rose to the task and unanimously defended the unity of the Union.

The reaching of this agreement does not however end discussion on the form of the Union or on the position in the new structure of countries which are not part of the euro area. We now face the very important task of the proper application of the provisions of the compact in practice. Particularly important for us will be how Article 12 of the agreement will be implemented, and, therefore, if the voice of the countries which have signed the compact but which are not part of the euro area will in fact be heard during Eurosummit meetings.</literal>

               More Europe is the answer! Finally the Member States have taken their responsibility by signing the Fiscal Treaty. Strict rules and fiscal discipline and joint efforts as the whole EU are crucial. Signs of protectionism and egoism have no place if the European project wants to succeed. Completion of the single market – loosing barriers to cross-border trade and services, completing the single digital market – is the key for future success. Doing business, using services, getting a job should be equally easy and accessible in the whole EU. The strong language on this must be transmitted to the official Spring Council conclusions! SMEs as drivers and backbone of the European economy suffer the most under unnecessary burdens and rules. Simplified procedures and exemptions are needed to enable the SMEs to pursue and focus on their main business instead of filling in administrative forms. Easy access to financing both from public and private sources will ensure sustainable and competitive SMEs. Youth unemployment has reached more than 30% in eight Member States. We have to enforce measures to enable easy access to labour market and quality jobs, significantly increasing the offer for apprenticeships and internships for young people, working together with the social partners.</literal>

This is a denial of democracy made all the more unacceptable by the fact that the budgetary thresholds which it will impose are completely new and have never previously been mentioned in any of the EU Treaties.

This treaty also interferes with national constitutions to an unprecedented extent, by forcing them to include an instrument to limit public spending. This new treaty also includes the Euro-Plus Pact, which constitutes a dismantling of social rights.

               –Twenty-five Member States have reached an agreement on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, which is an essential element in our efforts to maintain stability and an example of solidarity and determination that the Union is prepared to resolve crises. European leaders have been forced to adopt tough measures to stabilise the euro area.

Financial stability is an important, but not the only element in the effort to ensure economic recovery. We need discipline, structural changes, jobs and sustainable growth. The use of European funds must be optimised. There is a need for practical proposals to tackle the problem of youth unemployment and finance SMEs. We are entering a phase of economic governance based on the European semester, in which national governments recognise that areas of national competence must be approached at European level as well. The European economy must become much more competitive and this becomes possible only through the completion of the internal market. Therefore, the Commission must ensure that all laws regarding the internal market are applied in the Member States and must oversee their implementation. This Treaty is a big step forward towards fiscal and economic integration and towards a better governance of the euro area.</literal>

               –The Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union is a much needed step forward. In the current crisis that we are experiencing, fiscal stability is an essential element which we cannot abandon. Clear, precise rules needed to be included in a treaty to guarantee that they would be respected. Of course, it is a shame that the treaty has not received support from all of the Member States. However, we cannot be anything but pleased with the final version which has been adopted. Significant advances have been set out in it, such as formal recognition of the golden rule, reverse qualified majority voting and intervention by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Furthermore, the final text has been made more consistent with European law, and particularly with the six-pack which came into force in December. Finally, we must not forget the difficulty of the European negotiations: managing to reach an agreement on such a text in such a short space of time is a real triumph. The treaty represents, first and foremost, a clear political will: it promotes responsible economic governance.</literal>

               –From the standpoint of improving economic governance in the EU, a positive view should be taken of the fact that the fiscal compact introduces instruments of a new quality which will contribute to the pursuit of a more responsible fiscal policy in the future. The most important of these are the balanced budget rule, the obligation of the Member States which have signed the compact to implement this principle in their national legal systems and the increased jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The effectiveness of the fiscal compact will, however, be verified only in practice, when its provisions become binding on the Member States. This is because there is a risk that the introduction of statutory automatic correction mechanisms may force the pursuit of excessively pro-cyclical economic policy, which will exacerbate the debt crisis. Another source of doubt continues to be the question as to the frequency with which Member States that are not part of the euro area will participate in Eurosummit meetings. The international agreement states that countries whose currency is the euro will be able to hold meetings only amongst themselves when the subject of discussion is to be responsibilities with regard to the single currency or other issues concerning governance of and convergence in the euro area. In relation to the fact that the range of subject matter for closed meetings of Euro Group members can be interpreted very broadly, it is very important from the point of view of guaranteeing the priority of the Community method that in this case a literal interpretation be applied.</literal>

               The fiscal stability pact fails to provide effective measures to tackle a major problem Europeans face as one of many consequences of the economic and social crisis. A main focus must be in the fight against unemployment, especially youth unemployment, which continues to increase. As this forms one of the rights of the EU and is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, it is both unacceptable and irresponsible that this burning issue is so neglected. The focus in this time of uncertainty should be on solidarity and growth, to protect and support the Europeans most affected by the crisis. In Greece, for example, the ranks of those in poverty swell whilst the supply of social services is slashed – forsaking those in most need of help is not the way to induce recovery and growth. Moreover, it is not fair. We need to focus on the social consequences of the crisis; this involves giving hope and support to especially the younger generations. There are some positive signals, but they are negligible as methods to stimulate growth. Additionally, the pact is to be condemned as it represents an infringement of the Community method.</literal>

               –On 30 January, the Heads of State or Government adopted the text of what is known as the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, also called the fiscal compact. Positive amendments to the initial version of the text include the obligation to implement the compact in the treaty structure of the EU within a maximum of five years, the consistent relationship with the law of the Union and the prevention of a severe breach among the Member States. We have to remember that the treaty which has been adopted is just one of several elements of the fight to rebuild confidence. It is still an instrument which serves principally to increase fiscal discipline, whereas there are other causes of the current crisis in the euro area. Structural reforms are needed, which will restore the confidence of financial institutions and improve rating agency ratings. Changes in the European labour market are needed just as urgently as the setting in order of Member States’ finances. The labour market must be made flexible to enable a more effective fight against unemployment, particularly among young people. Work on the system of financial surveillance needs to be completed. The small and medium-sized business sector should receive additional support, because it is in fact this sector which has created 80% of the jobs in Europe in the last five years. Despite the fact that the European Parliament has opposed the international agreement in every form, preferring EU secondary legislation instead, we cannot allow ourselves to voice severe criticism of the fiscal compact. In supporting this document we will give a clear signal to those outside the EU that the Union is determined to eliminate the causes of the current crisis.</literal>

               –At the European Council of 30 January, 25 Member States signed the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. The new Treaty makes it compulsory for Member States to have national budgets that are balanced or in surplus, otherwise an automatic mechanism will be triggered to take corrective action. The Treaty will be signed in March and will enter into force after being ratified by at least 12 Member States of the euro area. Within maximum five years after entering into force, the Treaty must be incorporated in EU law.

The Treaty represents the signatory states’ firm commitment to strengthen fiscal discipline. Austerity measures, however, do not guarantee economic growth. Through the deterioration of the quality of life of many European citizens and the increase in the share of population at risk of poverty, austerity measures have created real social crises in some Member States, and have led to the deterioration of the European social model.

We regret that at the European Council of 30 January Member States did not make a similarly firm commitment to stimulate employment, especially among young people, to finalise the single market, increase competitiveness in EU, and stimulate the financing of economy, in particular that of SMEs. These are essential for maintaining the European social model and for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy.</literal>

We may go further and say that the compact is in fact of no use to the European Union. Apart from the obligation of the Member States to incorporate the deficit thresholds into their constitutions, there is nothing new in the agreement. It is, however, worth pointing out that the negotiations were about something much more important than the budgetary commitments of the Member States – they were about the future of the European Union. During the negotiations we were answering the question about whether the unique Community method would be rescued, and also about whether decisions on EU economic policy were to be made exclusively by way of selfish negotiations between Member States on principles known to us from the congresses of the 19th century. We were also answering the question as to whether new intergovernmental institutions were to be established which would compete directly with the EU institutions. Finally, we were faced by the real possibility that sanction would be given in the Union for a division into the equal and the more equal. For the time being, we have managed to put that grim scenario behind us.</literal>

               –This intergovernmental treaty is not just unnecessary, it is also undesirable. There are actually two key reasons for this.

The first is that it is undemocratic. The European Council is creating a legal tangle because the mutual agreements between the Member States are outside European legislation. In the first instance, the role of the parliaments will be reduced to a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’. In the European legislative procedure, on the other hand, account has to be taken of the European Parliament’s position, as a fully-fledged co-legislator.

Secondly, with this treaty, Europe’s Heads of State or Government are laying down in stone a medicine for the wrong ailment. The fact that Christian democrats and liberals have now been preaching for three years that only blind cuts can get Europe through this crisis is no longer newsworthy. However, the idea that this ideological agenda should now be laid down in constitutional terms is beyond belief.

Quite how far out of touch this is with citizens’ worries only gets more striking if you make a comparison with the growth strategy that the same Heads of State or Government put forward barely a couple of years ago, the Europe 2020 strategy. That strategy remains empty rhetoric for the time being and any form of enforceability of the objective of reducing poverty or getting more people into work is a long way off.</literal>

This agreement is not only legally questionable, as it flouts the role of Parliament, but also harmful, because the budgetary restrictions imposed will not resolve the crisis but, on the contrary, can only aggravate the recession. The renegotiation that we are calling for is a logical consequence of that. We must create growth in order to come out of this crisis: this is an economic necessity, and the dogmatic view imposed by Merkozy is not remotely adapted to this. We must restart a virtuous circle by coordinating our economic policies with major joint industrial projects, particularly in the fields of energy and the environment, and by boosting major infrastructure. This can only be achieved through the creation of Eurobonds, which are completely absent from this text, and true regulation of the financial markets, which we have long been calling for. Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel’s obsession with strict austerity is becoming dangerous for the whole of Europe.</literal>

The expression of solidarity is the most important of these priorities. We must continue on the Euro-Plus Pact path and consolidate solidarity between Member States in and outside of the euro area. The process of integration of Member States’ sovereignty must continue in order to ensure solidarity. We, the politicians, the MEPs, must explain to our voters why integrating sovereignty does not mean surrendering it, and must rebuild their trust in the Community’s future. Thus, they will be more confident in developments that will take place in the near future and in our approach to build a new Europe, more united and coordinated under the democratic primacy ensured by the European Parliament, the only European institution whose members are elected directly by citizens. I support the idea that the European Parliament should gain a more important role in decision making, and that the President of the European Parliament should attend all meetings of Member States leaders.

Developing common approaches is different from managing day-to-day crises. We need to be ready for crises.

It seems to us to betray a desire to grow the service beyond its existing remit, before the EEAS has been able to fully prove that it brings real added value in terms of the improved efficiencies which were promised at the outset, such as cuts in EU Member State bilateral embassies as a result of the new EU multilateral diplomatic input.

It has also become your baby, Baroness Ashton. I must give you initial credit for the setting-up, at a time of general EU crisis, of this controversial service which understandably you believe deserves more taxpayers’ money. But the ECR has consistently argued for budget neutrality and for rationalisation of the EEAS’s resources.

The EU missions and their relative sizes are often still distributed according to historical legacies and, some cynics might even argue, pleasant postings, with large delegations in some parts – e.g. Fiji – and none at all in other growing regional economic hubs, such as Panama, which do not always reflect the EU’s current geopolitical priorities.

It is the countries with nuclear capability that do not want other countries to obtain the technology. Therefore, Baroness Ashton, I believe the time has come for the EU to promote an international treaty to ban the world’s entire nuclear arsenal and destroy it in a sustainable way.

To my mind, that would be the best and most credible political proposal, at international level, in order to put a complete stop to the hypocrisy of countries with nuclear weapons not wanting other countries to have that same capability.

               –Baroness Ashton, the problem is that in the same region another state has not been judged with the same yardstick, namely Israel. It has never been subject to a single embargo, nor has it received a single warning, even though the State of Israel has nuclear weapons. That is why I believe that this is the discourse that needs to be straightened out once again.

My final comment on the matter is that I hope there is no possibility that any road map for embargos or sanctions concerning any state in the region might result in military intervention, and that no such solution is being considered. I sincerely hope that no military intervention is being planned.</literal>

  ,–Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, the Arab Spring has led not only to political changes but also to new challenges and threats to stability. One of these is the growing phenomenon of arms smuggling.

Since the fall of Gaddafi in Libya, the Egyptian authorities have been reporting a sharp increase in arms smuggling in the Sinai Peninsula. Surface-to-air missiles, rockets and anti-aircraft guns have been stolen from army barracks abandoned by Libyan forces and now supply a black market for weapons, destined for the Gaza Strip and Hamas in particular. This is a very worrying phenomenon because these arms are capable of shooting down civilian aircraft during take-off and landing and may end up in the hands of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida, for example in the Maghreb.

How, I ask, can we help to mitigate this growing threat and who are our potential allies?</literal>

  –Madam President, Baroness Ashton, as a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy I would like to ask you specifically about the energy embargo imposed by the European Union on Iran, which in my opinion was clearly a political decision.

When this decision was made, did you thoroughly consider what serious implications it could have in terms of disturbances in the security of European energy supply? How will we explain to our voters here in Europe why a litre of fuel costs more than EUR 2, and how will we solve the problem of long queues forming at petrol stations?

I am asking this in light of the fact that as far as I know, the State of Iran allowed the investigation committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency to enter its territory, and so far the committee has not found any evidence, that is, there is no evidence that Iran would indeed be conducting research into nuclear energy for purposes of war.</literal>

  –Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world and is experiencing a political crisis that can only be solved through the application of the road map leading to the presidential and legislative elections. This country is experiencing negative growth. Normally, our contribution is close to 50% of this country’s budget. The European Union has, rightly, suspended its budgetary support for national indicative programmes (NIP) from the 9and 10European Development Funds, but not for the Millennium Development Goals. Meanwhile, the population is suffering and companies set up in Madagascar are sometimes called on to help in spite of themselves.

While we support your position, we should like you to use all of your influence with the Southern African Development Community, so that the legal mess concerning the return of the former president is cleaned up as soon as possible, since this subject is one of the elements that is most sensitive to the application of this road map.

  –Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the method being followed by the EU in its relations with the Iranian regime is a combination of diplomacy and sanctions. However, let us make no mistake: we are talking about a brutal, dictatorial, inhumane regime, and we all know that it is impossible to reason with those who are unreasonable. The attack on the British embassy in Tehran is a stark reminder of the Iranian regime’s concept of diplomatic relations.

With that in mind, my specific question is as follows: given that Iran is clearly violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty, would it not be appropriate to set a fixed, non-extendable deadline for it to fulfil its obligations and, if it does not do so within that time period, to impose truly effective additional sanctions?</literal>

So many of the debates that we have had in this past year, one year after the Arab Spring, have been about the humanitarian crisis where repression has continued. Instead can I ask her to comment today about where progress has been made – in a country like Jordan, and she has already referred to the King of Jordan in relation to the Middle East peace process. Are there lessons to be learned about transition without the need for violence? And in a country like Tunisia – where of course we have had what were widely accepted constituent elections and where the Arab Spring began – what lessons are there for the depth of the deep democracy for which she strives? Could she comment on the lessons that she has learned?</literal>

On 16 December, a peaceful protest at Zhanaozen ended in bloodshed. There were many injuries, at least 15 deaths, as well as arrests and incidents of mistreatment, torture and rape.

The legislative elections of 15 January were deemed neither free nor democratic by observers.

  You will not be surprised that I want to raise the question of Camp Ashraf.

As you know, last December Martin Kobler, the UNAMI (United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq) Special Representative in Iraq, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Iraqi Government without first having got the approval of the residents of Camp Ashraf which he had pledged to get in advance. Nor was he acting in accordance with the wishes of the UN Secretary-General, who said that the Ashraf people must approve the MoU. Yesterday he issued a press release saying that Camp Liberty is ready for the displacement of the 3 300 people from Ashraf, when in fact there is no freedom of movement – they will not be allowed to take their personal possessions, they will be surrounded by thousands of military and police.

This is not a refugee camp, this is fundamentally a prison. Please, can you insist that the Iraqi Government uphold its obligations and not allow them to get away with this kind of unorthodox treatment.</literal>

This is contrary to the position taken by Parliament several years ago, because the Iraqi authorities have clearly violated the relocation programme, launching missile attacks against the camp. I think the role of your representatives has lately been rather marginalised because they have even been denied a visa for Iraq.

I put it to you that, if you say that the relocation to Camp Liberty is the way for the future, I think it is a very ominous way.

I know that you and the ministers for foreign affairs are aware of this, because on 23 January you decided to extend the legal grounds for new sanctions for Belarus. At the same time, however, despite the fact that visa sanctions have been imposed on the Belarusian Minister for Internal Affairs, he was able to travel to France, attend an Interpol conference in Lyons and return safely to Minsk.

               –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, on 23 January the Council took a difficult but consistent decision, and for that I congratulate Baroness Ashton. This Parliament will support the Council conclusions in the resolution we will vote on tomorrow.

As you have just explained, it was difficult because it required sacrifices by several Member States, and it was consistent because it is in keeping with the positions we have defended so far. Both the President of France and the Prime Ministers of France and the United Kingdom have said that they will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.

However, as well as being consistent, these measures need to be effective in order to promote the path of dialogue, bring Iran back to the negotiating table, ensure its full cooperation with the inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and also, Baroness Ashton, to silence the drums of war that can be heard. Israel has said that all options are being considered, and one Republican candidate in the United States has said that swift action should be taken.

Furthermore, some Iranian ministers have said that these sanctions will be ineffective, because the EU needs Iranian crude oil more that Iran needs the EU’s resources. What is more, the threat to close the Strait of Hormuz and the risk of escalating tension in the region could have serious repercussions for oil prices and further complicate the difficult economic situation we are going through.

That is why, Baroness Ashton, I would like to say to you that, beyond the internal dimension and the consistency that were shown in the Council decisions of 23 January, it is also important to take action with our allies at this stage as regards our external scope and influence. You just told us that you visited India; the stance taken by India, Japan and other countries is vital to ensure that the measures adopted can have the effect that many of us are hoping for.</literal>

               –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Iran will continue to be a critical issue in 2012, which has just got underway. It will continue to play its destabilising role both globally and regionally, based on a lack of transparency as regards its nuclear programme and its position as the world’s third largest exporter of crude oil.

However, the fact that it is the world’s third largest oil exporter means that the oil industry, as you said, represents 80% of Iran’s income, and that could make our sanctions more effective.

Baroness Ashton, although Israel and the Republican Party in the United States have reached a level of tension that is unacceptable to us, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament totally and expressly rules out the military option. We support the European twin-track approach that you mentioned, and we support proportionate sanctions aimed at companies, political leaders and economic agents, thereby minimising their impact on the general population. However, Baroness Ashton, the EU should reactivate the second part of that twin track, namely, diplomacy. We should stay focused on the rigorous inspections carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and on Iran’s acceptance of all the safety measures the IAEA imposes in exchange for the production of enriched uranium for civil use, as permitted by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

The point is not to limit ourselves – as you did in the letter you addressed to the Iranian negotiator in October – to demanding that Iran relinquish its capacity to enrich uranium as a precondition for dialogue. The IAEA should take every available measure to monitor Iran’s uranium production, and in turn we should create trust-building conditions and measures, with a broader and more ambitious agenda in our relations with Iran.</literal>

               Mr President, Iran replied to the most recent EU sanctions with surprise, a surprise not only mentioned by officials but also reflected in the further decline in the value of the currency, as the EU remained united in its sanctions package of 23 January. The EU is strong when it stands united and leads, as the Vice-President/High Representative has said. Let us see more of it.

However, isolating Iran is not a success or goal as such. The ALDE Group would urge the Vice-President/High Representative to work with Turkey and other partners, to do everything possible, to use all diplomatic means available to encourage Iranian officials to engage in meaningful negotiations over the nuclear issue. This also means looking into different ways in which Iran might be persuaded, and not just at sanctions.

The EU should also look at having a permanent representation in Iran and eventually open an EU representation on the ground, to relay more directly our joint concerns over human rights violations, besides our vital role in the E3+3 negotiations. May I remind some Members on the conservative side of this House especially, that sanctions are an ultimate means and not a goal in and of themselves. I am proud and glad that the EU has always clearly distinguished between seeking to impact individuals with responsibilities for either the nuclear programme or human rights violations, but not the Iranian population. They, after all, feel largely unrepresented by their political, military or religious leaders.

It is therefore even more important that the EU acts independently of the United States, especially in an election year. The US has consistently chosen different sanctions packages to the EU, but the US sanctions also impact EU businesses by imposing not only direct but also indirect sanctions. I believe food and medicine should always be able to reach the Iranian people.

One last point that is of particular importance for the people in Iran, especially the young generation, and that is the role that technologies can play in either enhancing or threatening human rights. I believe the EU should take its responsibility in ensuring, at least, that no repressive technologies are exported to such repressive regimes, and this we can do now without controversy.</literal>

Many of us, however, are also very concerned at the possible negative effects on the Iranian population. Parliament’s opinion has always been that there cannot be a military solution to a nuclear conflict with Iran. We should not leave any ambiguity about this question and the Greens have proposed an amendment to this effect.

The EU has a dual-track approach to sanctions and negotiations. Sanctions have been enforced. Now it is time for negotiations. The question is: how can we open up for negotiations? The Iranians have said they are willing, and I think one of the things the EU has to accept is that the Iranians will not suspend all uranium enrichment as a precondition for sanctions. We strongly urge all parties to negotiate seriously and without preconditions.

Iran and the West have taken turns in rejecting each other’s offers for compromise, and several opportunities have been missed because the phases of goodwill between E3+3 and Iran were not synchronised. I hope this will not be the case in the future. We would also like to see Turkey and Brazil involved in the negotiations. They were proposing compromises in this respect and would be good partners to have included. If we manage to continue negotiations, this could then open a new historical window to the nuclear-weapon-free Middle East. The EU should support actively this UN conference and be helpful in setting a road map for this process.

The Greens think that the EU should also set a good example and give up nuclear energy, as Germany has decided. The example of Iran clearly shows there is no way to clearly separate nuclear activities for civilian uses and the use of the same technologies for military aims.

As a goodwill gesture showing the EU’s readiness for dialogue, we should finally open an EU representation in Tehran and Iran should receive security guarantees, as it is very difficult to bring a country to the negotiating table under a permanent threat of war.</literal>

               Mr President, Iran’s nuclear military ambitions and its government’s constant refusal to engage with the IAEA and UN Security Council demands constitute a major threat to global security. They also pose a potential risk to peace in the Middle East, with an existential threat to the State of Israel in particular. They are also likely to lead to a regional arms race, with neighbouring Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia also wishing to acquire such nuclear weapons if Iran is allowed to possess one in breach of its NPT international legal obligations.

We must now all hope that measures agreed by the European Union, even with political support from countries like Greece, Spain and Italy, which are large importers of Iranian oil, will put economic pressure on the regime and make it much harder for the leadership to move money around the world and will force Tehran to come back to the negotiating table. It shows that when there is a clear and urgent need for action the EU does not always dither and dodge the issue. This is Europe speaking as one voice for once on the most serious global threat and I would encourage Iran to start listening.

Traditionally Iran should also showcase the legacy of its glorious Persian culture. Instead it is sadly one of the most brutal, theocratic dictatorships in the world, having suppressed all opposition to the last flawed presidential elections, and a country which carries out shocking public executions of homosexuals, those guilty of so-called sexual misdemeanours, including minors, as well as exporting terrorism via its proxies, such as Hezbollah, to neighbouring countries. It also regularly interferes in neighbouring countries, from Bahrain to militarily propping up the Syrian Ba’athist dictatorship. All the more reason, therefore, why it must never become a nuclear power. Contrary to what some have said, no future or further options to prevent this should be excluded from the negotiations.</literal>

               . –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most recent sanctions by the EU are not confidence-building measures, but sabre rattling. That is a fact. Attempting to get Iran to compromise by exerting more pressure is politically naive and also irresponsible.

As the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, we do not want any nuclear programmes, that is clear, including in Iran. We strongly condemn the Iranian regime on account of its horrendous human rights violations, oppression of religious minorities and persecution of human rights activists, but stopping Iranian oil as a result of the de facto trade ban with Iran’s Central Bank will ultimately hit ordinary citizens. That is a fact. It will also help the Iranian regime’s election campaign ahead of the elections in March this year and will increase the risk of war throughout the region. That, Baroness Ashton, is the scale of what we are talking about here.

There is as yet no genuine proof that Iran has a current nuclear weapons programme. There are indications up to 2003, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has provided no evidence for the period thereafter in its report. It has assumptions and the claims of the secret services.

Instead of an escalation, we need a human rights dialogue and serious negotiations for a nuclear weapon-free Middle East and peaceful coexistence throughout the region. That is what the EU should be doing instead of making the current situation worse.</literal>

Even the authority of Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, is being openly discussed. Right now, the opportunity is presenting itself for the international community to steer Iran away from its misguided nuclear path. It is perhaps the last such opportunity.

High Representative, you are personally aware of how extremely difficult it is to bring about truly serious negotiations with Tehran. I really hope that you will find a united transatlantic – did you hear that, Ms Schaake? I said transatlantic – front behind you in 2012. That transatlantic front does not, at this point in time, suffer from any divisions over the Persian Gulf. Think of the assistance that the United Kingdom and France have given to the US navy, despite all the hawkish rhetoric and provocation on Iran’s part. This transatlantic position also supports the International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspection regime. That is the current test case for Tehran, as asserted by none other than Ali Larijani, current chair of the Iranian parliament, just yesterday.

Baroness Ashton, the contours of the Islamic schism between Sunnis and Shi’ites are on full display in the Middle East once again. Iran’s nuclear ambitions threaten to bring about a nuclear arms race. Your job, Europe’s job, is to help prevent that disastrous scenario.</literal>

  –Mr President, the current Iranian regime is unjust, there is no doubt about that as far as I am concerned. As an Austrian, I can also demand a nuclear weapon-free Iran without employing double standards. The fact is, however, that there is currently no evidence for the existence of Iran’s nuclear weapons programme. The current International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report talks only of a possible military dimension. A current US study also talks of limited opportunities for uranium enrichment for military purposes.

It is also right, in any case, that we should block and prevent a military solution based on false arguments. My question for Baroness Ashton is therefore as follows: what, in fact, is your plan B? In other words, what are you going to do if the sanctions do not work, or if the sanctions do not bring about the desired measures? What do you intend to do then?

Secondly, I have another question regarding Camp Ashraf. As we know, the deadline has been extended. Camp Ashraf is to be moved.

  –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that what we are aiming to do with the draft resolutions and what Baroness Ashton has presented to us here fit relatively well together. I, too, am of the opinion that the sanctions need to be stepped up and that they must be imposed in such a way that they are not counterproductive and they do not result in solidarity between the population and the regime, but rather have the opposite effect.

I believe that we should make it clear that this regime, which is a true dictatorship, is not complying with the conditions of non-proliferation and that, for that reason, measures in accordance with the UN resolutions, in other words like those now being taken by the European Union, have to be implemented.

However, I also believe that the regime should be warned against attempting to take action in the Strait of Hormuz, because that is not in the interests of the regime. After all, with our proposals and with these sanctions, which are also directed at a larger section of the population, particularly that consisting of the undertakings of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, we want to try to make it clear that the European Union is seeking an approach that will not require any military action and that, if these sanctions are not intended to take effect until 1 July, there is also still time to prevent this from happening if the message is properly understood.

Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you for saying that these messages will be conveyed through our decisions and discussions and through partners like Turkey, but I hope they will also be conveyed to a greater extent by countries like Russia and China, which need to accept their responsibility in this regard so that a clear message is sent out from the international community.

I believe that, on this basis, we should be able not only to stabilise a regime, but also to ensure that the world does not become less safe and that this sort of regime does not become equipped with rockets and nuclear weapons. No one has anything against a peaceful nuclear model, and I believe that, for that reason, this regime should at long last be prepared to cooperate with the international community so that no one has any reason to take military action.</literal>

  Mr President, the Iranian authorities persist in enriching uranium at a suspicious level which is incompatible with their stated ‘peaceful civilian purposes’. We say that we are strengthening sanctions, but are we sending strong enough warnings to all European agents that sanctions are not to be circumvented this time? This is a very dangerous year, with US elections on the horizon and intense sabre rattling in some quarters in the US, Israel, and even in Europe.

The EU should rule out a military solution which can only spell disaster for the region and beyond, notably Israel. Instead, in our dual-track approach, we should consider exploring a broader settlement by all diplomatic means. We could do this by recognising Iran as a regional power and establishing a diplomatic mission in Tehran and by shifting the non-proliferation focus to an internationally controlled fuel bank which Iran could access. We could create a weapons-of-mass-destruction-free Middle East by working for regional security and economic arrangements, which would include Saudi Arabia and possibly Israel, thus guaranteeing inviolability of current borders and economic progress for the region. And we could send clear support and solidarity to the Iranian people, namely those fighting for basic human rights, making clear that sanctions will not target the people and produce counterproductive effects that would only fuel the opportunistic propaganda of the regime.</literal>

  –Mr President, I was particularly pleased about the Council’s decision to impose sanctions and an oil embargo and to increase the pressure on Iran. I consider this to be the sensible and right thing to do and I am amazed to hear many fellow Members saying that there is no proof of military intent or that it is not possible to distinguish between civil and military use. We only need to look at the facts. Iran has 5 000 kg of uranium that is enriched to 3%. That is what is needed for energy production. However, it already has 75 kg that is enriched to 20%, and the only explanation for that is that it is planning to use it for military purposes. The enrichment needs to be pushed to 90%. That is technically complex, but by no means impossible.

All of the facts, including the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), indicate that military use is intended here. In other words, we have a predictable period here in which the whole scenario will enfold, and it is therefore right for the European Parliament to now increase the pressure. The same applies with regard to the delivery systems, commonly known as missiles. The Iranians are obviously working on medium- and long-range missiles. This brings the urgency of the situation even more clearly into focus. It would have been better if the oil embargo had been put into effect immediately – although I fully understand the need of some Member States to find means of diversification. However, that will also give Iran the opportunity to find ways round this.

I am pleased that the joint parliamentary resolution received broad support. I am also pleased about the particularly constructive role of the IAEA, in particular since Yukiya Amano took over the position of Director General. That is extremely helpful, and I am also pleased to see the positive and constructive role that Turkey has been playing recently with regard to this matter.</literal>

  Mr President, the lessons of the Arab Spring hold true for Iran just as much as for any oppressive government anywhere in the world. Khomeini, Ahmadinejad and their fascist colleagues in Tehran are not immune to the winds of change that are sweeping across the Middle East. They see the writing on the wall and that is why they are intensifying their efforts to build a nuclear weapon so that they can reassert their authority in the region and hold the free world to ransom.

We have surely by now recognised the abject failure of our policy of appeasement. Our attempts to appease them has simply provided the regime with time to continue its promotion of terrorism worldwide and its construction of nuclear weapons at home against a background of desperate oppression and human rights abuse. Therefore, I welcome tougher sanctions against this brutal terrorist regime in Iran. It is worthy of note that they are one of the few remaining countries who still support Assad in Syria. There is no place for dialogue with these tyrants. Let us work robustly for regime change.</literal>

  –Mr President, nuclear weapons are among the vilest weapons there are and they should be abolished worldwide. Civil use of nuclear energy is impossible to control. We therefore need to do everything we can to ensure that there is a worldwide move away from nuclear power and towards global nuclear disarmament, and specifically in this case towards a nuclear weapon-free zone in the Middle East – and we must do so in a peaceful way.

Until then, the current treaties will apply. As worthy of criticism as the regime in Iran is, it should be noted that, unlike India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan, Iran has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It therefore exercises the right to the civil use of nuclear energy guaranteed to all states that have signed this Treaty. That is dangerous – just as it is dangerous in other countries. No one thinks – quite rightly – of taking military action against all the states that have nuclear power plants, or penalising them with sanctions. Neither the secret services nor the most recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency provide solid evidence that Iran is building, preparing or planning nuclear weapons.

Yet blatant threats of war have been made against Iran for many years on precisely this pretext. In addition, there is an increasingly aggressive economic war being waged with the intention of destabilising the country. This policy, ladies and gentlemen, is a serious danger to world peace and limits the opportunities for progressive opposition in Iran. As is so often the case, it seems very much as though peace and human rights are to fall victim to the global interests of the United States and the EU.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, it is difficult to be optimistic. If Tehran were to have nuclear weapons, it would seriously destabilise the area between the Mediterranean and the Caucasus and could trigger a nuclear arms race in neighbouring countries that for various reasons are afraid of Tehran, such as Saudi Arabia or Turkey.

The latest Iranian Shahab-3 missiles can reach EU Member States such as Greece, Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, and would make the Tehran regime’s threat to destroy the State of Israel possible. A nuclear Iran really could block the Strait of Hormuz, making any political or military countermeasures extremely risky. We cannot afford a new North Korea in the Middle East.

The new sanctions imposed by Europe are certainly a positive step, but time is running out to find a diplomatic solution to this crisis and avoid the military option.</literal>

  –Mr President, on Friday Tehran will probably adopt an emergency law that will stop oil supplies to the EU with immediate effect. As a result, all Member States who have agreed to a boycott of Iranian oil supplies will immediately have their supply shut off. This will be the case even though the EU has treaties that will remain in force until July.

In the short term, however, the EU embargo will hit the civilian population. In the medium term, China will be the one to benefit as it will cover its energy deficits magnificently with the European quota that will be freed up. This would balance the losses from the EU embargo, so that there would ultimately be no further pressure on Tehran. In other words, the oil boycott would not achieve the desired effect and the EU would be placed at an even greater disadvantage in geostrategic terms.

We ought to pay more heed to competent exiled Iranians who warn that boycott measures will affect the wrong people, because it will lead to solidarity within the country. For this reason, the EU should seek to exert a moderating effect, using all its resources to avoid an escalation.

The aim would, of course, be for there to be absolutely no nuclear weapons in the Middle East. It also goes without saying that the security of Israel must in any case be ensured.</literal>

  –Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes the Council’s decision of 23 January to extend the existing sanctions against Iran. It concerns the toughest sanctions imposed on the Tehran regime so far. After freezing the assets of a long list of companies and individuals in Iran and restricting exports of sensitive products and investments in the field of hydrocarbons in Iran, the next logical step was to sanction oil resources, which have a strategic importance for this country.

The adoption of sanctions is never something that is made lightly. In the case of Iran, these measures are all the more necessary as the risk of nuclear proliferation linked to the Iranian programme causes increasing concern. I believe, therefore, that it is very important that the EU has shown decisiveness, in the absence of a clear answer from Iran to the proposal of resuming the negotiations. Toughening the sanctions and our firm tone are a clear indication for the Iranians that we will not accept the continuation of the nuclear programme.

Finally, for those who argue that sanctions are ineffective or even counterproductive, I would like to point out two aspects that I believe to be important: sanctions so far have actually hindered the Iranian nuclear programme and have prevented Iran from obtaining the nuclear bomb. On the other hand, Iran started to show signs that these measures have an effect on its economy. Sanctions are therefore the key to resolving the nuclear crisis and can bring Iran back to the negotiation table.</literal>

  –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you can see that there is very broad-based support across all party lines for your position in the European Union. I believe that the intransigence of the Iranian regime – and that is clearly a serious understatement – leaves no other option than the imposition of strong sanctions, although I admit that I do also have some mixed feelings.

I do not know – you are the expert, and we undoubtedly have other experts – whether there are many known examples of cases where sanctions have also effectively led to regime change. It is a tool that always attracts the necessary criticism. That is all well and good, but we need to get behind it.

There have been a couple of important comments in the extensive debate that we have had here. I, along with my whole group, take the view that these sanctions must not represent a stepping stone to military interventions or to an armed conflict in the region and in Iran. I believe that that must be clear and I do not believe that we need the military threat in order to be able to bear our teeth. I believe that a military conflict would be bad for the region, bad for Iran and also for Europe, and that it is therefore not an option.

Secondly, in a broader context – and I am very pleased, Baroness Ashton, that you also made reference to this – I still have a great many concerns about the situation of the Iranian populace and human rights. In this area, too, there are things we can improve in our own back yard. There are still businesses in the European Union whose technology is sold and used to oppress people in Iran, for example via communications technologies, whether communications technologies used to listen in or spy on people or, for example, to deny them free access to the Internet.

Here, too, Baroness Ashton, I think that we need to make sure that we get our own house in order. I hope that you and the Commission will do what is necessary to ensure that that is the case.</literal>

They are entitled to respect and their history, which goes back 4000 years, needs to be taken into consideration. I should like to make three points. The first has to do with the fine line we need to tread when we impose sanctions, in terms of who is most affected by them, the elite in government or the people. I fear that it is the people who will pay in this case and that the result will be the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. The second has to do with energy sanctions. Energy includes multiannual, 40 to 50-year contracts, large infrastructures and increased prices for consumer goods throughout the entire planet.

  Mr President, it is quite right that governments across the world are deeply concerned at Iran’s nuclear programme and the threat to global security that is posed. As many colleagues have said, this is a brittle regime not concerned with the human rights of its citizens, and one which has posed a constant threat to the State of Israel and contributes to the tinder box situation in the Middle East.

It is therefore quite right that appropriate sanctions are put in place in order to encourage Iran to enter into negotiations. A further escalation of the nuclear programme, which is undoubtedly about developing nuclear weapons, or attempts at acts such as closing the Strait of Hormuz, would be entirely unacceptable.

I welcome the resolution of the international community in this matter. The decision by the UK, the US and French Governments in sending warships and the aircraft carrier through the waters of the Strait of Hormuz sent the right signal. It is important that we have one voice and the resolve to stand together to protect the safety of our citizens, but these must not only be about dialogue and diplomacy: we need to retain the threat that actually we will take action if this continues.</literal>

  Mr President, I think we are now entering a new and extremely difficult phase in our relations with Iran – or rather in our lack of relations with Iran. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency confirms that Iran has the knowledge and the desire to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has repeatedly tried to keep hidden from the IAEA the truth of its actions and to impede the work of the IAEA inspectors – as it is doing now.

Internationally Iran has threatened to take military action against our allies and to block the Strait of Hormuz. Internally we see more and more repression of democratic movements, and that really concerns us. There is no hope that the March elections in the country will bring about any change in those policies.

Therefore the European Union has no choice but to act, and it was right to impose sanctions. The current threats from Iran make it clear that we can no longer support this undemocratic regime by buying their oil. Right now we have to put pressure on Iran to engage fully in negotiations. These negotiations cannot be just a talking shop or a sham to play for more time but must seek to halt and clarify the nuclear programme. Baroness Ashton, you should not accept anything other than straight talk and a real exchange of opinions. We can begin to talk about renewed imports of Iranian resources only when Iran applies the United Nations resolution and the suggestions of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</literal>

  –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, today’s debate in the European Parliament is extremely important. The imposition of new sanctions against Teheran was absolutely necessary; however, it is equally necessary that we try to exhaust every possibility of bringing Iran back to the negotiating table.

The decision by the European Union to impose sanctions may have been necessary but it will not be easy, because it will increase oil prices and because it will, at the same time, cause problems with the energy reserves of numerous countries.

They will also come at a high economic cost, especially for the countries in the South and especially if the financial crisis is taken into account. On the other hand, we must not forget that Iran is able to channel its oil to other, non-European markets.

However, there is a more important point, because we must ensure that sanctions are properly targeted and that their effect on the Iranian people is kept to a minimum.

I consider, Baroness Ashton, that you should exhaust all means of persuading Iran to cooperate constructively on the nuclear issue, although that should not be the only issue.

The international community and Europe appear to have forgotten the terrible human rights situation in that country.

I think that you should remind Teheran and draw their attention once again to that issue. In any event, armed conflict must be avoided at all costs. Conflict in the already heavily-burdened Arab world is in no one’s interest. I worry that the red line drawn by the United States in connection with attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz is dangerously escalating the situation. Of course Iran must duly persuade the West that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes and of its intention to cooperate. We all know that that is not self-evident.</literal>

  Mr President, on weapons of mass destruction, one should remember how politicians and media liars queued up to demand action against Iraq over WMDs. That propaganda lie justified sanctions and an illegal war. MEPs who voted for sanctions against Iraq over those non-existent WMDs might have meant well, but they helped to murder hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, who died through lack of food and medicine. Now it is nuclear weapons of mass destruction. It is a new target, Iran, but the main victims will be the same – children – because a successful oil and banking embargo would make it impossible for Iran to buy enough food and medicine for its population.

If the EU votes for sanctions it exposes itself as bankrupt – not merely financially, but morally too. If Saudi Wahabis and Zionist neo-Cons want war with Iran, that is their business, but it is not ours, and we should stay out of it.</literal>

  –Mr President, thank you and let me congratulate you specifically. I will continue in English.

Iran’s nuclear programme is I think without any question a source of potential danger for the wider West Asian region, but we should not allow ourselves to be mesmerised by the nuclear issue because that way we run the risk of missing several other strategic developments. For one, Iran is a major power in conventional military terms; indeed militarily it hardly needs nuclear weapons. Secondly, Iran has the potential to block the Strait of Hormuz. This has already been mentioned. This would affect oil exports from the entire Gulf region – I want to stress that – and it would involve around a fifth of the world’s oil consumption. Then, with Iraq gradually evolving into an Iranian satellite, Tehran’s power has increased markedly. The uprising in Syria, another of Iran’s allies, directly affects Iran’s interest, hence the support extended to the Assad regime.

In all it is not hard to see the ultimate objective of Iran’s strategy: control of the Gulf, the neutralisation of Saudi Arabia and the exclusion of the United States from the region. The nuclear question is only a part of these strategic issues.</literal>

  Mr President, I welcome the EU decision to place an embargo on Iranian oil imports, ban new contracts and freeze Iranian central bank assets, because the recent EU decision, coupled with existing American measures, will come close to imposing the ‘crippling sanctions’ referred to by the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.

It is important to note that the EU, as a block, is Iran’s second largest customer, taking about a quarter of Iranian exports. The latest set of EU and US sanctions goes beyond targeting the persons and institutions involved in the nuclear programme. Hopefully those sanctions will achieve their aim, but more important is that the EU Member States are perfectly aware of the possible consequences and that the respective governments are prepared to deal with them.

The European Parliament, in its resolution, makes a strong statement in support of the EU’s dual-track approach for the negotiations with Iran, which offers both rewards and punishments. What is clear is that we are far away from trusting the current Iranian regime and, at the same time, we would wish Iran to become a country like Japan, which has the capability to become a nuclear power quickly if need be, but which has rejected taking the final steps to possessing nuclear weapons.

Finally, in this context, what could give negotiations and diplomacy a chance is the ever-changing situation in Iran and in the region, including the move towards democracy in the Middle East.</literal>

               Mr President, Iran is situated in a highly sensitive region. An Iranian nuclear weapon would mean practically an additional threat to peace in this area and a way of exercising control over neighbouring countries. I therefore agree that it is necessary to clarify the intentions of this country. However, we must ask ourselves whether or not a general sanction on Iranian oil will give the expected results.

I believe we cannot punish the whole society for the mistakes made by the ruling class and, therefore, sanctions should be aimed at those who hold the power. I would like to draw your attention, Baroness Ashton, to the need for ongoing assessment of the effects of these new sanctions. At the same time, the European Union must constantly encourage dialogue with the Iranian side and, as you have already mentioned, use the relationship this country has with Turkey. However, dialogue must not be limited to the nuclear problem, but also include the human rights situation, as many of my colleagues have already said.

With regard to this last aspect, the European Union should impose restrictions on EU companies to suspend exports of goods, particularly electronic goods, that are actually used for the oppression of Iranian citizens.

Finally, I would like to point out that the only solution to the tense relations with Iran is a peaceful one. Military intervention would be a major mistake, with disastrous consequences. The European Union, through its High Representative, must declare firmly that it is against military intervention and must express that it is open to dialogue.</literal>

  –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I am in no doubt that the European Parliament must speak out on Iran and its nuclear programme. It is not we, but the International Atomic Energy Agency which has serious fears over the possible military aspects of the Iranian nuclear programme, and as the evidence shows, Iran is working on the creation of a nuclear explosion device. We did not force Iran to become a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, in relation to which Iran itself has renounced attempts to obtain nuclear weapons and is legally obliged to report all the nuclear activities which it conducts. It is not we, but Iran which still is not meeting its obligations under the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, including the latest of these, resolution 1929, and is not complying with the requirements of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is not we, but the policy of the Iranian Government in some areas which is creating a threat to stability and peace in the region.

In this nuclear atmosphere, I would like you to remember, Baroness Ashton, about other problems related to Iran, which, after all, you have spoken about yourself: respect for human rights, and the situation in Camp Ashraf, which continues to be uncertain and unsafe. Members also asked about this during Question Hour. I should add that we must do everything possible to work together to resolve these problems.</literal>

This approval was granted without the consent of Camp Ashraf residents, despite the promise of the UN Envoy, Ambassador Martin Kobler, that such approval be obtained.

The EU should take a much more active role, with Baroness Ashton’s direct involvement – especially after the refusal of the Iraqi Government to let it play an active part in the negotiations. In addition there are approximately 900 Camp Ashraf residents with links to Europe. Therefore, we need to stand shoulder to shoulder with our US friends in exerting pressure on Iraq and the UN for a quick and humane resolution. By the way, people like the refugees of Camp Ashraf are our best hope for a democratic and nuclear-free Iran.</literal>

I think it is important that we are united in supporting these sanctions. That is how we will get others to follow suit, as Australia has done, for example.

I am surprised that the opposition to these sanctions, here in the European Parliament for example, has been so great. I expected unanimous support. Iran’s sabre-rattling is not a sign of failure, but rather it is a sign that the sanctions entail consequences. I do not understand those who are opposed to these sanctions. Who in the Iranian opposition have they actually spoken to? I have met with and spoken to members of the opposition and they welcome the fact that we are getting tough with Iran. No one want to punish the Iranian people, but the actions of the regime have consequences. Unreasonable behaviour that goes against the united view of the international community must have consequences. There is a cost, and there must be a cost, which is what we are demonstrating with our sanctions. This is welcome, therefore.</literal>

This is the first serious signal to the Iranian Government. The Iranian regime’s oral statements that theirs is a peaceful nuclear programme are unsubstantiated and unconvincing. Meanwhile EU policy continues to be a dual approach, so it is entirely up to the Iranian authorities whether there will be even greater restrictions on the country’s economic development. The goal of sanctions is above all to ensure the removal of a substantial risk to global security and regional stability in the Middle East. It is disappointing that certain countries with global ambitions are unable to eschew narrow national interests and stand on the side of global security – I am talking about Russia and China. I nevertheless believe that we have to set out very clear conditions and criteria for lifting the sanctions announced.</literal>

If international obligations are to be justified, and if they are to have any meaning, then they should also be both enforceable and enforced. We therefore fully agree with the EU’s approach to Iran in the area of sanctions.

On the other hand, it should be emphasised that these sanctions must target leading figures in the regime, not the people who live in Iran and who already have a relatively hard life. In addition to this, there is also another dimension, in the form of diplomacy and diplomatic negotiations. I firmly believe that if we try to lead these diplomatic negotiations into other areas, and if we can show convincingly that we are interested in a proper partnership even with countries like Iran - not just with the regime, but with the country as such – then we will also succeed in monitoring the nuclear regime in Iran.</literal>

The European Union has again appointed itself as the global guardian, as required by its imperialist values and interests and by competition with other forces in the Persian Gulf and Central Asia. The coercion being attempted by the nuclear powers on the pretext of Iran’s nuclear programme is insulting. Those same forces back Israel’s policy of aggression and nuclear weapons, the innumerable nuclear weapons in Europe and the dissemination of nuclear plants in India and Pakistan. I am certain that the workers will condemn this provocative action. Joint exercises between Israel and other countries and the war against the people of Iran need to be stopped.

This will affect Italy, Spain and Greece, which are the countries already hardest hit by the debt crisis. Equally, if Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil route, we will have a real oil crisis on our hands.

We know that weapons of mass destruction have already been used as a pretext for preventive military action which had a questionable basis in international law. Even though the threat of military intervention seems to have been averted with the move from a nuclear dispute to an oil dispute, it must be obvious to all of us that a military strike against Iran could have devastating consequences.

However, we must, of course, oppose the secret construction of nuclear weapons in the same way as we oppose preventive military strikes in contravention of international law. All of us, including the countries of Europe, must ask ourselves how we can guarantee security, for example for Israel, under these circumstances.</literal>

The country has disregarded her commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as well as a number of United Nations resolutions. Iran constitutes a serious threat in the region and the implications of such a strained situation will have their reflection at a global level. I endorse all possible sanctions against Iran as well as other diplomatic measures that can be taken in order to make Tehran see that we are serious and that we do not hesitate to ‘put our money where our mouth is’. However, I must caution against reacting to any provocations or engaging in any military action. The region is a barrel of gunpowder and I am deeply concerned that when it goes off we will not be able to keep it under control. Therefore, let us be alert, yet not neurotic.

I was nonetheless hoping that, in this sensitive issue, our esteemed Council would not follow its usual path when measures do not work, which is to apply the same measures but only in greater quantities. The Council hopes that sanctions will bring Iran to the negotiating table, but experience to date shows that these and similar measures have only contributed towards a deepening of mutual distrust and an assertion of the political and economic interests of the various superpowers. After the deterioration in international relations over the recent situation in the Gulf of Hormuz, it can now be expected, moreover, that the negative impacts of sanctions on the Iranian people will strengthen the position of the current regime even more. Unfortunately, I cannot rid myself of the impression that some countries are not out to prevent military intervention or even war in Iran, but, on the contrary, are encouraging it for various reasons. We cannot allow this to happen.

I would venture to say, therefore, that the EU should stop focusing only on the Iranian nuclear programme, and abandon the current path of sanctions and yet more sanctions. On the contrary, dialogue must be held, with a view to future cooperation at several levels, for example regional stability, foreign affairs, human rights and mutual assistance. A positive situation at one of these levels might then help when negotiations are stagnating. Boosting mutual confidence and respect is the only route that does not lead to imminent armed conflict.</literal>

Its rapid development, and the threats being issued by Iran against the countries of the region and against Israel, are the cause of increasing anxiety. Unfortunately, looking at the EU’s options today and at Iran’s strategic position, it is clear that Iran’s military forces have the capability to paralyse the supply of crude oil through the Strait of Hormuz, and also to destabilise Central Asia and North Africa by conducting asymmetric activity through a network of terrorist groups. Action of this kind would appear to be more dangerous than Tehran’s nuclear programme itself. Therefore, pressure should be maintained for more frequent inspections to be carried out on Iranian nuclear installations. In addition to this, it is also important to support the Iranian opposition. We do not have accurate information, but it seems that Tehran’s activities are a kind of domestic ploy before the forthcoming elections, in which President Ahmadinejad’s position is under serious threat. The threat that the supply of crude oil might be cut off also shows that the European Union must provide more funds for the support of projects intended to diversify fuel supplies.</literal>

In the article, Mr Putin states that today’s Russia is dominated by the state, that it suffers from serious corruption and that everything needs to change. That is good news for the citizens of Russia, as well as for us. Would it not be great indeed if it were possible to break through a failing culture and turn the country into a true democracy?

Yet, Mr President, what also struck me was that there was no mention in the article of people in Russian society. While there is a recognition that the market needs to be given new freedoms in order to generate new confidence, there is a complete and utter lack of any consideration of freedoms for people. A society where people are subordinated to the market, where people as individuals or collectively are denied fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms, will not function, despite all the fine words.

If Russia wants to be modern and prosperous there needs to be real work done there, twenty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, in order to properly tackle all the deficiencies in respect of freedom and there needs to be a real effort to get going in respect of working towards a true democracy. Mr President, we have seen – and Baroness Ashton has just said – that in the past the democratic rights of citizens were trampled on. We saw this with theelections. We hope and expect that things will be different in the presidential elections, but the signs are not good.

What applies when it comes to human rights in Russia also applies to Russian influence beyond its borders. If the Russian regime is to be believed, it will refrain from using its veto irresponsibly and it will thus not protect the Syrian regime, nor actively support it with weapons to be used on people who are simply seeking their freedom. Mr President, we can now find out whether these were merely words, or also translated into deeds.</literal>

               . –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the presidential elections in Russia on 4 March will show whether the government in Moscow has learnt its lesson. They will make it clear whether the processes have been improved and whether we can hold out hope that there will be positive developments in this area.

However, the many demonstrations that have taken place since the beginning of December make me very hopeful. They are an indication that civil society is gaining strength and, therefore, for me they are also a sign of hope.

At the same time, the large-scale demonstration due to take place on Saturday also highlights the problem faced by the Russian opposition and the protest movement. The so-called systemic opposition parties, which are represented in the Duma, are to a large extent not regarded by the population as being a viable democratic alternative. The inclusion of the nationalists in the protest movement is, thank goodness, giving rise to heated debate. I believe that we need to show solidarity in particular with those who have joined the White Ring protest over recent days and weeks.

These citizens come from a wide range of different areas of society and are taking action to protect their civil rights, without having an ideological axe to grind and, most importantly, without any kind of self-interest. They do not want to form a government. Instead, they want the right to freely elect a government. This makes the movement even more convincing.

What Russia most urgently needs are state institutions and elected officials who have democratic legitimacy and the trust of their voters and who make a clear commitment to serving the interests of the voters and to combating corruption and other abuses of power. Therefore, we must give this movement our support now and make it increasingly clear in our discussions with our Russian partners that we are happy to cooperate with them, but that we also want to see joint progress being made towards more democracy.

Those of us who are members of the EU-Russia delegation will definitely be discussing this when we visit Moscow in eight weeks and it would be good if the Commission could play an active role in supporting the delegation.</literal>

               Mr President, once again we find ourselves debating a Russia which is struggling on its way to build a genuine democracy. Every time the European Parliament discusses the situation in Russia, its counterparts in Moscow express their discontent about foreigners getting involved in their domestic home affairs. Instead of considering our constructive criticism, the Russian authorities point to other issues of a completely different nature.

We all know that the Duma elections were neither free nor fair. The situation with the presidential elections is one of. An absence of free media and the behaviour of the central electoral committee is depriving the electorate of the possibility of making a genuine choice. The demonstrations by Russian citizens show that people want free and fair elections. We need to applaud their efforts and the maturity of civil society in Russia.

The attempts of Prime Minister Putin and his court to preserve power will provoke instability that will endanger our partnership for modernisation: investors will not be attracted to corruption and the idea of Russians packing their bags and fleeing the regime does not match our expectations either.

Legitimacy of presidential power is crucial for the development of Russia, including for its status in international affairs. There are big question marks over its place in the G8 and other international fora, especially in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

The ALDE Group is glad to have the EEAS, at least, in place, to coordinate our European policies towards Russia. With one voice we can, of course, achieve more.

Europe needs a stable and reliable partner. However, the recent statements by Mr Lavrov on Iran, for example, are not at all encouraging for further cooperation in the security field. We therefore wish you, Madam Vice-President/High Representative. This Parliament is ready to cooperate with you.</literal>

               . –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, while we are currently experiencing Siberian cold weather, the political situation in Russia has been hotting up since the fraudulent Duma elections of December last year, which were manipulated.

The findings of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the election monitors from the Russian NGO Golos have shown that these elections were not free or fair. Since then Russian civil society, which we believed had sunk into apathy, has begun to take action. A growing protest movement has emerged, which is fuelled by self-respect. It is calling for an honest Russia that will no longer tolerate paternalistic rule. It is also demanding the annulment of the Duma elections, the removal from office of the head of the central electoral commission, new elections under the terms of the new election act promised by Mr Medvedev for 2013 and, most importantly, free, fair and correct presidential elections.

Perhaps what we are seeing in Russia is what we had hoped very much would emerge from the Arab Spring and which is now regarded with scepticism: a genuine democratic new beginning, the birth of a civil society. The poet Dmitrii Bykov described the situation very aptly during the big demonstration on 24 December when he said that life with all its dangers and risks is awaiting a newborn baby, but the baby has now been born and he cannot be pushed back into the womb.

Russia’s controlled democracy is escaping from state control. If, as some people say, it really were a sovereign democracy and not a stage-managed one, no one would need to be afraid of genuine elections, because the elected government would be able to rely on sovereign power.

Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said that Mr Putin wants economic competition, as he recently explained, because he has been forced to acknowledge that, without competition, the rule of law and the fight against corruption, it will not be possible to modernise Russian society and to develop a healthy SME sector. However, this also applies to the regeneration of society, which will not be able to make progress without political competition and debate and this has been gradually blocked since Mr Putin took power.

However, the crippling social contract which is based on the principle of ‘you let us live and we will let you govern’ has now been terminated. Civil society is taking back its political rights. After fighting for the right of freedom of assembly, next Saturday the protest movement will begin its struggle for the right to demonstrate. It will be 22 years since the memorable date of 4 February 1990, when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Moscow to call for the removal of the article in the constitution which enshrined the leading role of the communist party.

Today the demonstrations are against the Kremlin’s monopoly of power and in favour of the separation of powers. They are about the choice between Russia as an alternative power on the basis of its raw materials, together with Putin’s ‘power vertical’ involving the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), and a democratic, pluralist, knowledge, information and market society which has an open relationship with the EU. The question is whether given all our efforts to establish a relationship, our willingness to cooperate and our modernisation partnership, we will be able to bring about a real partnership based on values.</literal>

               –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, we are giving thought, before the elections, to what to talk about in relation to Russia. Vladimir Putin knows that we like the word ‘corruption’, and he also knows that if there is to be a fight against corruption, it will be something new. We are behaving a little like children: we are looking around just trying to find instances of corruption, as if we were not paying attention to what has been going on in Russia recently or to the mistakes which, often in good faith, we ourselves have made. What were the two mistakes which we should remind ourselves of today? The first was the application of double standards. We have been using double standards in the belief that we will somehow calm the situation down. Today, these double standards can apply to energy, for example, because it is being said that Gazprom may be granted a partial exemption from the principles of the third energy package. By the way, I would like to take this opportunity to ask you, Baroness Ashton, if there is a chance that this will happen, and I wonder how you evaluate Gazprom’s proposals? They are very important. We should not, today, be sending a signal that we are willing to use double standards, because then the entire third energy package is pointless.

The second thing is the myth of stabilisation. Today, when there are young Russians on the streets, we know they will not gain power, but we have made a mistake in relation to many countries when we have talked about stabilisation for the sake of peace and quiet. Today we have to address ourselves to these groups, to young people, and therefore the signing of the agreement on local border traffic between the Kaliningrad oblast and Poland was a good move. It was a good move – leading the way to relaxation of the visa regime. Let us move in this direction, Baroness Ashton. Let us not forget these two lessons: let us never again employ double standards or the logic of stabilisation. We must concentrate on development, youth and the future. This will bring results both to Russia and to the Member States of the European Union. This is what I wish you today, Baroness Ashton.</literal>

More than one area of this kind exists. Therefore, it is increasingly surprising that this House is content simply to give a mutual confirmation of its values.

The results of the poll in Russia yesterday should be making us think much more carefully about the situation. The poll showed that the Russian population wants a modern country with a stable economy which is more than just an exporter of raw materials. However, only 7% of the population believes that the EU is prepared to help with the necessary reconstruction. This figure has not only halved, but is also particularly low in areas which are in close contact with the EU. We should be discussing the related issues here, including democratic values, involvement in society, the prospects of the election and the emergence of a political and civil society in the Russian Federation, particularly against the background of the contradictory experiences of the Russian people during the Yeltsin era.</literal>

               . -Mr President, after the December elections to the Russian State Duma, numerous protests were held in Moscow and other large cities in the country, drawing attention to suspicions that the election results were rigged. Representatives of opposition forces in particular have been demanding a recount of votes assigned to individual political parties, as they were convinced that the declared results of the elections do not genuinely reflect the will of the people.

The fact that the state bureaucracy is reviewing the discrepancies reported by the opposition, and that the state is respecting the protests of opposition forces shows that Russia is moving towards a better balance of political forces, and that the opposition today can reach far more people than in the past. Nobody who takes a realistic view of political relations in Russia expects that the stronger voice of the opposition puts at risk the success of Vladimir Putin in the March presidential elections. It is clear from the shift in voter preferences, however, that if Mr Putin wants to be a good president for all Russians, he will have to pay much more attention to the views of his constructive opponents.</literal>

  –Mr President, we should not necessarily overestimate the revolutionary mood in Russia. Unlike in the Arab States, the protesters are not students who have brought about a rapid radicalisation of the movements, but the Russian middle class. In addition, the protest movement does not have any well-known political leaders. Last but not least, the opposition is often not aimed directly at Putin, but at corrupt local authorities. If Putin does not make any more big mistakes, he will be re-elected as president, as surely as night follows day.

However, Russia obviously has a great deal of catching up to do when it comes to democracy and human rights. That is not surprising when you think of the major problems which Russia has to overcome as a result of its 70-year communist history. Nevertheless, we are seeing some progress and some compromises, for example in the legislation on political parties and the fight against corruption. The EU itself is not perfect. We also have democratic deficits. Freedom of speech is constantly being put at risk here. Pressure is being exerted on the media in the EU as well. Therefore, Brussels should not always take it upon itself to lecture others about democracy.</literal>

  –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, in giving consideration as to what policy we are actually pursuing towards Russia, I have reached the conclusion that it is a kind of mixture: a little naivety, a little illusion and a little hope. This concerns both the situation inside Russia and what we call democracy, and also Russia in its external relations and foreign policy, because of course Russia does have what are said to be democratic institutions, elections and a parliament, and there are political parties which do appear to compete with each other, but at the same time we must not forget the fact – and it is to be welcomed that we do talk about this fairly often in this Chamber – that Russia is still a country in which journalists disappear, in which unjust sentences are handed down, and in which political opponents are persecuted.

In its foreign policy Russia is also a country which on the one hand supports our actions – the work of NATO, the United States and the European Union in Afghanistan – but on the other hand is supporting Syria and is behaving on this matter in a scandalous manner, and is even working against what is being said by the Arab states. It remains, therefore, to ask where is that hope? There is hope now only in the Russian nation. In Poland, too, we once thought that change would never come, and yet we are today in a completely different place.</literal>

  –Mr President, Russia’s accession to the WTO, at the end of 18 years of negotiations, opens a new perspective on international trade relations. I think we must appreciate the Russian party’s willingness to amend almost 300 laws in order to comply with the international trade rules and to reduce custom duties in many industrial sectors.

The prospect of doubling the European Union-Russia trade in the next 5-10 years is, however, conditioned by the modernisation of the Russian economy and by the full assumption of a real democratic framework. The EU-Russia partnership is conditioned by compliance with democratic values and rules. Therefore, we are concerned with the fairness of presidential elections this year, in particular in the context of the protests that followed the parliamentary elections in December. The screening on Sunday of the opposition leader on the official TV channels, for the first time after so many years of censorship, is an encouraging sign that all candidates will have unrestricted access to mass media. However, this first broadcast also demonstrates the democratic deficit affecting Russian society. That is why the electoral process is not a guarantee for democracy, except to the extent to which the elections will not be flawed, including the electoral campaign stage.</literal>

  Mr President, as the High Representative will know, in English we have the expression ‘the elephant in the room’ to describe something which we know is there but we do not officially recognise. Well, the European Union has a ‘bear on the doorstep’ in the shape of Russia. My first point relates to what we say – I will come on to what we do in a minute.

What we say in our official statements in relation to Russia is very modest. I do not think it really reflects the attitudes of Russians. On my recent visits to Russia I found really very deep discontent with the decline in democracy in that very important country. There is corruption, and there is a clear failure of the democratic process. This so-called ‘managed democracy’ might be acceptable in Egypt, where my friend Ayman Nour has been prevented from standing as a candidate in the presidential elections, but it is wholly ridiculous that Grigory Yavlinsky has been banned from standing as a presidential candidate in Russia.

When it comes to what we do, apart from making clearer statements criticising the failure of democracy in Russia, I would pay tribute to the Commission and the EAS for increasing the budget for the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights by 34% in response to the Arab Spring, and I hope that we can focus quite a lot of that effort on Russia itself.</literal>

Nothing more and nothing less. Our relations will surely not be improved by this, but our mutual links will persist, particularly in the finance and energy sectors. Instead of making constant recommendations to Russia, we should think about how rapidly we ourselves manage to resolve the crisis-related, fundamental problems of the Union. We should also reflect on the fact that Russia is gradually changing. I have known it for decades, and not just from visits of a few hours and prepared meetings with selected partners.

In the second programme, Tony Blair’s former aide Jonathan Powell recounts the famous ‘spy rock’ scandal story. The Kremlin had accused MI6 of funding Russian human rights groups and other NGOs and using a fake rock located in a Moscow square filled with electronic equipment to communicate with their secret agents. Mr Powell confirmed this story (whether it is true or not), and the BBC elevated it to the status of a scoop by issuing a press release.

The FSB reacted promptly, publicly accusing two leading NGOs – Memorial and Golos – of being subversive and extremist organisations funded by the West. Both organisations are now under systematic harassment by the authorities. Powell’s claim is either untrue or illegal under the Official Secrets Act. The BBC is guilty of gross journalistic irresponsibility, and this shows once again that Putin’s is a gangster regime.</literal>

  –Mr President, Russia is an important neighbour for the EU, for both geographical and historical reasons, and it is also a very significant economic and energy partner. Furthermore, it is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

Russia is one of the actors needed for efficient global governance capable of dealing with global problems, and we also need increased cooperation from Russia on issues such as the situation in Syria, which is on the brink of civil war, or the nuclear threat from Iran.

I believe, however, that the EU wants a relationship with Russia that goes beyond those global or regional interests. Russia is a European neighbour, and a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

I believe that we would like a relationship of real trust and friendship with Russia, based on shared values and principles. That is why we want a new association agreement and why we want for Russia what we also demand of ourselves: a pluralistic democratic regime that respects civil and political freedoms, and a rule of law in which corruption and arbitrariness are the exception.

However, the organisation of the legislative elections in December did nothing to strengthen that trust. The irregularities of the election process are well known, as are the serious accusations made.

I hope that the next presidential elections will not show the same shortcomings, and that Russia can finally start to move towards clear democratic progress and modernity, which is what its European partners wish for.</literal>

For the EU, the immediate challenge is to help ensure a fair and inclusive electoral process and to be prepared for a range of scenarios. But we should not lose sight of the big picture. Regardless of the outcome, Russia will be, politically, a different country from a year ago. Pressures for political and economic reforms will only grow. Russia’s internal evolution will have major implications for our bilateral relations in terms of political dialogue, trade, visa policy, human rights and possibly also the broader security environment in Europe.

There is a strategic opportunity for a new and more effective EU policy towards Russia, but we need to readjust our policy in a flexible and timely manner.

  –Mr President, I would like to express my admiration for Baroness Ashton’s patience and her balanced and intelligent response. Earlier this evening we talked about Iran and the nuclear threat posed by this country. It goes without saying that Russia could play a very different role to the one it is currently playing with regard to Iran – right now and in the future.

The same applies with regard to Syria. It is unreasonable for Russia to be allowed to act in an underhand way, as it is doing where Syria is concerned. The Russian foreign minister recently said the following: ‘The Russian policy is not about asking someone to step downRegime change is not our profession.’ He also said: ‘We said that the decision should be made by the Syrians, by the Syrians themselves.’ He is, of course, very well aware that 5 000 Syrians have been killed and many thousands more have been displaced or treated in an inhumane and abhorrent way.

It goes without saying that we should talk about how corrupt – at least to a certain extent – the Duma elections were. We should have high expectations ahead of the presidential elections, of course, but it is without doubt deplorable that one of the countries of the Security Council should have a right of veto and then be able to behave the way Russia is doing in terms of its foreign policy.</literal>

  -Mr President, most of us perhaps can remember the Cold War and the collapse of the bipolar world. I myself come from a country that was for many long years under the influence of the Soviet Union – the predecessor of the Russian Federation. It would be very wrong to say today that nothing has happened in the Russian Federation in terms of political reforms. The Russian Federation today is different from the country we knew in previous times. It would also be wrong, however, for us to say that the reforms to date are sufficient and that we have no interest in monitoring further developments and the further progress of political reforms in Russia.

We should think very carefully, however, and modify the tone that we adopt in such a discussion. Baroness Ashton mentioned that we had a major debate on the Russian Federation in the European Parliament's part-session in mid-December. Less than two months have passed and we are again discussing the Russian Federation in the European Parliament's plenary. Imagine how often the situation in the EU is debated in the Russian Duma, and how often there is criticism in the Russian Duma of the corruption in EU Member States. We issue calls every other month for the Russian Federation to combat corruption. Where there are proven cases, let them be handled under the applicable regulations and laws which exist in the Russian Federation.

I also feel, however, that if we want to be critics, then our criticism should be objective, and if our criticism is objective, then we should also criticise corruption in our own Member States. If we criticise the fact that in Russia the opposition has no room to move, let us take a look at Romania. Does the opposition in Romania have room to move? This is a Member State of the EU. If we are talking about the dominance of a single large party, let us take a look at Hungary. Hungary is also dominated by a single large party, and we have also criticised here many times what is happening in this Member State of the EU. I would like to ask, ladies and gentlemen, only that our debate remains objective and constructive also in the case of the Russian Federation.</literal>

I was talking about the fact that if we criticise the situation in the Russian Federation and if some of our observations are justified, we should also criticise what is happening in Member States of the EU. I was not directly comparing any EU Member State with what is happening in the Russian Federation. I was just calling for a measure of objectivity and comparing criticism of the Russian Federation with what is happening here in the Member States of the EU.</literal>

  –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, there is no point in repeating the fact that Russia is an important economic and political player and a significant partner, since this has already been said several times. The human rights situation in Russia is very alarming. The Duma elections were a cynical example of how indifferent Russia’s authorities are to international standards. These standards were infringed more than in the past, but the protests in which tens of thousands of Russians participated did not evoke a response. We must confirm that we can hear the cries of the Russian people just as we heard the ‘Arab Spring’. Words alone will not help Russia to become democratic, if its authorities have no desire at all for this to happen. We must be done with double standards and stop turning a blind eye merely because Russia is a country that is large and rich in raw materials.

Russia’s increased interference in the internal politics of European Union states is alarming, and confirms that imperial ideas still hold sway. In October last year Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs initiated a new strategy to increase its influence in European Union Member States, firstly by attaining official-language status for Russian in the European Union. Back in November, the National Bolsheviks began collecting signatures in Latvia for a referendum on Russian as the country’s second official language, and this year the absurd project began for collecting signatures within the framework of a citizens’ initiative to achieve recognition of Russian as an official language in the European Union. For Latvia, where during the occupation the number of so-called russophones increased from 8% before the occupation to approximately 44% following it, the introduction of a second official language would mean the destruction of the Latvian language and consequently of the Latvian State. Russia’s wish to influence European Union policy is much more profound than we often believe it to be, and for that reason, Baroness Ashton, I call upon you too to turn your attention to it, since its consequences are likely to be extremely significant.</literal>

  Mr President, Russia is still unfortunately declining to join the UN resolution about Syria and in fact is continuing to deliver arms to the Syrian regime.

As for the elections on 4 March, in the eyes of the governing elite the result has obviously been decided, in so far as Mr Medvedev’s interlude will soon be over. In the view of foreign observers there is no real chance for credible decision-making, because the December elections were assessed as neither fair nor free. The convergence of the state and the governing elite has resulted in massive rigging and manipulations. Sergei Kolesnikov, Putin’s former ally, told us in December that Putin will stop at nothing to retain power.

There remains the question of the behaviour of the Russian voters. Here a real change has been taking place since December: a change of attitudes, mentality and hopes. Anna Politkovskaya’s warning more than six years ago of limitless political apathy among Russian voters has finally been heeded, and the result has been massive interest in monitoring and participation.

The EU now has a unique chance to influence the situation in a positive way, and I think the best way to do this is to follow the suggestions in Sir Graham Watson’s report, to be adopted tomorrow, about consistency towards authoritarian regimes.</literal>

  –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I wonder what must happen in our relations with Russia for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy – besides such general statements about support for values, democracy and democrats in Russia and saying how important Russia is for the world and the European Union – to present a thorough analysis of our relations and a proposal for a future solution to the many problems. After all, it can be clearly seen that the policy which has been pursued for many years – a policy of engagement of the European Union in relations with Russia, which was to lead to the modernisation and democratisation of Russia – has simply failed. The recent parliamentary elections were falsified, and in the forthcoming presidential elections the same candidate is going to stand for a third time – something which is unthinkable in Europe, although it is in accordance with the Russian Constitution. There is absolutely no cooperation, and, quite the contrary, there is support for regimes such as those in Syria and Belarus, there is corruption, and there is absolutely no competitiveness in the Russian economy, in which large state concerns dominate small and medium-sized enterprises. What more is needed for us to conclude that we need to draw up a new, more realistic policy on Russia?

There is one hope, and it is with this that I should like to close my speech. There is hope to be found in the Russian democrats who have stirred themselves, there is hope in the emerging middle class, there is hope in these people, and we should not be looking to our policy today for some kind of positive solution in Russia. Unfortunately, Baroness Ashton, EU policy towards Russia is bankrupt.</literal>

  Mr President, I hope that if the Vice-President/High Representative is extending sanctions against individuals in the Russian regime she will include Mr N.E. Konkin, who is the secretary of the Central Electoral Commission. This is the commission which has rejected the approach by Grigory Yavlinsky of the Yabloko to be a candidate for the presidency. His supporters collected over 2.5 million signatures in 71 regions of the Russian Federation between 24 December and 10 January, the only time really open to them – including getting notaries to check them – and the Electoral Commission has declared 20% of them invalid. The party is now being investigated by the public prosecutor of Moscow who is asking where the server of its website is located.

It seems to me that this is a politically-motivated move and a blatant disregard of democratic principles and international standards which will deny the Russian people the choice of an open, democratic, modern European perspective. I hope, Vice-President/High Representative, that you will be able to intervene to make sure that Mr Yavlinsky is allow to stand in the election on 4 March.</literal>

It is only right and proper that we should engage with Russia even if, as Baroness Ashton put it in her most diplomatic language, to do so is not without difficulty. But I think we have a duty to highlight issues such as the lack of fundamental rights, the non-free elections and, of course, corruption. I think we all accept that change will have to come from Russia itself. Perhaps the day of the Russian version of the Arab Spring may be closer than Mr Putin would wish.

Lastly, we should also look at the question of energy supply to Europe. We are far too dependent on Russian energy sources – and that needs to change.</literal>

Parliamentary elections in December resulted in unprecedented protests in Moscow and other important cities. We do not know exactly whether any fraud was involved. However, it is clear that Prime Minister Putin’s party was favoured, and the opposition greatly disadvantaged. There was a disproportion of means, of access to media, and of treatment on the part of state institutions. Presidential elections will follow. It is legitimate to make sure, through means that are also recognised by the Russian Federation, that they will be run correctly and all candidates will be treated equally. Guided democracy, which is in force in Russia, is a concept that is incompatible with the European Union’s founding values. I believe that it is in the interest of the Russian Federation to conduct the future elections fairly. This is the best way of increasing mutual trust.</literal>

The malicious campaign launched by those on the left against the Hungarian Government is just one instance of how ‘seriously’ people in Europe really take democracy and freedom of speech. Patriotic movements which try to go against the Brussels mainstream regularly become victims of hate campaigns in the political arena and the media. We should not therefore be pointing the finger at others. Because of our mutual interests in the field of energy, the EU should ensure that large companies like Gazprom comply with the competition rules on the energy market.

               –In the past few decades, Russia failed to implement the socio-political and economic reforms essential for modernisation. In respect of economic reform even China managed to overtake Russia, which is reflected in the 10-year difference between the two countries’ joining the WTO.

The Russian leadership must urgently initiate comprehensive economic and political reforms. It must restore the freedom of the political institutional system and the press. In order to stimulate growth it must launch comprehensive economic reforms. It must reinforce the rule of law and curb corruption.

Russia’s example, too, demonstrates how detrimental it can be if a single political force obtains excessive power and a constitutional majority, and eliminates the checks and balances of power. The European Union should step up against such practices both outside and within its borders. The protests that followed the Russian elections and have been ongoing for two months now have revealed the crisis of the Russian political system, which manifests itself on multiple levels.

The political capital of the Putin-Medvedev tandem heading the country has run out and the support of these two politicians has significantly diminished. Their peculiar controlled democracy, which made the operation of parties conditional on support from the executive power in order to ensure political stability, has also come to a dead end. This system aligned the electoral law to the expectations of the persons leading the country, and restricted the freedom of the press, as well as the free exercise of the right of assembly and the right of association. This could also serve as a warning to the authoritarian politics emerging in the EU.</literal>

               –The Russian presidential elections on 4 March of this year are raising questions among the international community, in particular with regard to whether the elections will be completely free and fair. These concerns are due to the last elections to the Duma, which saw an enormous number of violations of the rule of law and the process of free elections. The demonstrations that have been taking place show that Russian society wants change and reform, and that the deprivation of certain liberties will no longer be accepted as it was in the past. Moreover, there is the fear that this will merely consist of swapping posts and not of true democratic elections, based on a real choice. At the same time, Russia should meet its responsibilities in the international arena, in particular in the UN Security Council, in order to avoid a lack of response from multilateral institutions to situations like the human rights violations in Syria. I await the Russian presidential elections with interest, in the hope that the democratic process will genuinely be consolidated, as this country is a strategic partner and neighbour of the EU.</literal>

               Mr President, I am glad that Lady Ashton decided to participate in this debate. It is an honour for us and especially important because the EEAS has now been in action for a year and the time has come for the first reviews and summaries of the Service’s existence.

The report was adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs in December last year by an overwhelming majority. By allocating such an important topic to the Foreign Affairs Committee, the European Parliament wanted to emphasise that in foreign policy terms BRICS is no longer just a catch phrase coined around trade and growth-related indicators, but that these countries have come of age and started a certain form of foreign policy making. The report goes beyond the individual country-by-country approach when thinking about Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and tries to see in what senses their common points of interest have brought them together.

One such common item is the feeling of marginalisation on the global level, especially when it comes to BRICS participation in the key institutions of global economic and financial governance. That is why the BRICS countries have decided to strengthen their cooperation on political and foreign policy issues. It could be called a mutual support network, but one that can be a convenient fall-back option when the situation requires concerted action.

The report indicates several areas, in particular the number of votes held in the UN Security Council, on Libya, on Syria, on the status of the EU in the UN General Assembly and others, like recently in Durban on climate change, which show that when the foreign policy objectives of the BRICS converge they are ready to concert efforts and act jointly. In most cases the BRICS take positions opposed to those of the European Union and they contest our positions and policy.

Are we ready to react and to act? Those countries enjoy – some of them to a special degree, especially democracies like India and Brazil – a privileged relationship with us. At the same time, they will not give the Union the right to speak in the United Nations.

Baroness Ashton, in your report you praise the geographical desk structure of the EEAS as the leading source of advice and briefing on respective countries. The report which I submitted encourages a coordination mechanism within the EEAS which would allow geographical desk officers responsible for particular BRICS countries to exchange and coordinate information and positions in cases where concerted action on our side can be expected. Such cooperation would have added value for you and your officials in devising future strategies. The mechanism I suggest does not require a modification of the current EEAS structure and can be of a purely functional nature. I was told that the first time such coordination took place was in preparation for attending the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting to discuss my report. I am glad to hear that, as it is the best proof that the report has already brought some results. Now, it will be of the utmost importance that this coordination is maintained and developed further and does not become a one-time event in the history of your Service.

The BRICS as a cross-continental foreign policy actor does exist and the ostrich policy of hiding one’s head in the sand, believing that the BRICS will stop existing, will not serve the EU well.</literal>

               . –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, close cooperation between the European Union and the BRICS countries is absolutely essential in the light of the global challenges facing us, such as development policy in Africa. You have just made this very clear, Baroness Ashton. I would like to add that we need to move quickly, because the West will not be able to overcome these challenges on its own.

We must honestly ask ourselves the question of where our focus should lie in future: on spreading European values or on cooperating with China, for example. Because one thing is clear, which is that some of the BRICS countries prefer to take the route of gradual convergence rather than adopting binding, harmonised standards and rules. If we want to extend our cooperation, as a countermove we must take a more cautious approach to the issue of values. If we want to spread our values, then we must expect to encounter problems in our cooperation.

I am firmly convinced that the middle way is the best. Europe should not be preaching or behaving as it if it knows it all. We only need to look back at our history to realise that we have no grounds for doing this. We must be an attractive role model. It is clear that, in the light of the global challenges, we have no choice but to cooperate more closely. To sum up, the rise of the BRICS nations and the change in the world order are a major challenge, but also a major opportunity which we must make the most of. This report is a small step in the right direction and I would like to thank Mr Saryusz-Wolski for his hard work.</literal>

               Mr President, my congratulations to Mr Saryusz-Wolski. In today’s interdependent world, global problems need global solutions. Global solutions are necessary for international security, political, economic, monetary and ecological stability, as well as for access to raw materials and rare earths.

The financial crisis in Europe had its origins outside the Union, but to put our house in order and avoid negative externalities, the cooperation of the rest of the world is necessary. It is for this reason that coordination between the EU and the United States, and their diplomatic understanding and cooperation with the BRICS, becomes very important.

We need to correct East-West monetary imbalances – the deficit in the West and the surplus and trillions of reserves in the East – by deciding on upper limits of deficit and surplus and by fighting protectionism. The cake is common worldwide. The West is the market of the East, while stability and prosperity in the East are necessary for the security and healthy economy of the West. In this framework, the contribution of the BRICS, and particularly of China, in a specific IMF special-purpose vehicle, would significantly increase IMF firepower and robustness in dealing with the sovereign debt crisis of the EU and tomorrow – who knows – of the United States. In parallel, Beijing’s request for a further upgraded institutional role in the IMF and free market status in the WTO, which will anyhow be attained by 2016, could be accommodated.</literal>

               -Mr President, there has been a very lively debate on the BRICS countries. It shows that this is a challenge for us – not just for Parliament, but also for the European Commission and our foreign service. Our lively debate was firstly on the issue of whether the BRICS is a real economic or political-economic grouping, or just our abbreviation for a collection of countries with very strong and dynamically developing economies. The debate on this was very lively.

I personally believe that the BRICS is not an integrated grouping, and that we should not approach it as a single political unit – even though it is true that the BRICS can produce anunified viewpoint, for example in the United Nations. However, we should not overestimate this aspect. We must put far greater emphasis on the creation of bilateral partnerships – strategic partnerships - between the EU and the individual countries which we abbreviate into the BRICS, because these countries really are historically very different from each other. They are totally different countries, not just historically, but also in a practical geopolitical sense, and in their economic development.

Ultimately, however, we reached a compromise in this lively debate, agreeing that we must keep an eye on the BRICS so we do not lose sight of it as a partner, and that the EU must also develop strategic partnerships with large economic and political or geopolitical units such as Brazil, India and China, and so on. In my opinion, we ultimately came to a decent compromise – over the need to develop both instruments. This is proof of the fact that none of us had our heads in the sand in the end, and if we did then we have pulled them all out.</literal>

               Mr President, first of all my congratulations go to my colleague, Mr Saryusz-Wolski. He has at least made some progress and got things moving in the European External Action Service, as Baroness Ashton said, and that is a lot.

The BRICS countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – do not form a solid bloc on the international stage, but cooperation between them has an effect on international negotiations, agendas and final conclusions, for example at G20 summits. In the United Nations and Security Council, perhaps they have a more specialised role to play.

The BRICS countries are thus able very often to influence the agenda and priorities at negotiations, and this has sometimes weakened the EU’s position and our capacity for driving forward our own objectives. It is therefore vitally important that the EU can now develop strategic partnership programmes, and it is good that Baroness Ashton is visiting Brazil and other countries next week. It is a matter of urgency to develop these relations, and we will be doing absolutely the right thing if we view these countries as distinct, and act in accordance with each one’s history and current situation. They do not form a bloc, although they sometimes act together. The EU should also promptly create partnerships with these countries, and we need to think about priorities very carefully.</literal>

               Mr President, coming back to development policies, we need to acknowledge that the BRICS countries are also new and increasingly important players in development policy. In fact, we should welcome this. We should try to include them in our international agreements on principles of development – including, for example, aid effectiveness principles – without using their inclusion as an excuse for watering down our own commitments.

We need to foster south-south cooperation because experience from, for example, Brazil on how to fight poverty has been very useful: the poverty reduction programmes that have been implemented in Brazil have been a great success, and now they are being implemented in other countries as well. Such proven best practices will be very important and they represent an important step for developing countries and societies.

Another crucial recommendation in the Committee on Development opinion is to push forward the reform of global financial and economic governance institutions – notably the Bretton Woods institutions – with the aim of ensuring broad representation of all member countries while reflecting changes in their economic weight. Can you tell us, Baroness Ashton, what steps the Commission and the EEAS intend to take in that regard?

We must also not forget that a large proportion of the world’s poorest people still live in the BRICS countries and therefore we cannot treat those countries as high-income countries. The EU-India free trade agreement, for instance, will have massive implications for India’s small farmers, fishermen, fisherwomen and other poor people. It is not right to look only at a country’s overall GDP because that is not a true reflection of the reality. We need to find new ways of dealing with emerging countries. Helping the poorest in these countries will continue to be necessary and important.

The Committee on Development also asked the Commission to define specific areas of cooperation with the BRICS countries in the field of development policy, for instance cooperation in the health sector, including access to basic healthcare services and infrastructure, the fight against AIDS and other matters. Maybe you could also give your view on that, Baroness Ashton, and tell us what steps you will be taking.

I will conclude with a word about our own position. Too often we have heard that what we are doing in developing countries may not be the greatest thing – but if we did not do it, China would come along and do it even worse. So I hope we will never hear that excuse again.</literal>

               –Mr President, the growing political and economic relevance of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa means that a coherent and efficient EU policy has to be developed for these countries. This should not be determined by our fears or apprehensions about the emergence of new powers, but should be based on cooperation and the building of mutual trust. Relations with the BRICS should be based on real partnership, but – and this is important – it should also be based on common values. The Union must duly take into account the new weight, in political and economic terms, of the emerging powers, to maintain its own international position. For these reasons, several priorities identified in the Saryusz-Wolski report need to be given emphasis and support.

The concept of bilateral strategic partnerships with each of the countries concerned will strengthen the Union’s position. Support should be given to the renewed partnership with Brazil on the basis of the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement, which will be the most important association agreement ever signed by the EU. Brazil may also serve as an excellent example to us of building self-sufficiency in energy, due to its support for the production of biofuels. We should also highlight the role of the strategic partnership with Russia, which will foster the maintenance of peace and security in Europe.

Finally, I would like to express the hope that the Union will properly appreciate the importance of China as a future major economic power and will become a leader in contacts with China, with the aim of achieving economic recovery in our continent.</literal>

The European Union must take serious account of the new specific gravity at political and economic level which the BRIC countries are acquiring, by making use of the political authority which they are developing. I also agree with the rapporteur that a differentiated approach is needed to each country. Their economies are structured differently and their experience from the global recession also differs. However, we should not forget that, the recent impressive economic growth recorded by most of these countries notwithstanding, they still have the highest concentration of poverty in the world. In addition, even though they account for 42% of the population of the planet, they only produce 17.4% of global GDP. Comparisons currently come out in favour of the European Union. The question is: what will happen tomorrow?</literal>

  –Mr President, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, I would like to compliment you, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, on the European Parliament report you have drafted on relations between the EU and the BRICS. The report does indeed make a very good job of capturing the essence of the times in which we live. The world around us is changing dynamically, and one of the signs of these changes is the rapid development, and in particular the economic development, of countries which not long ago were only considered to be what we call developing countries. The result of this rapid development is, naturally, a growth in political relevance. Today they are no longer just economic powers, but increasingly important political actors, and, as Mr Saryusz-Wolski has observed in his report, the Union needs to develop a coherent strategy governing our relations with them.

I do agree, however, with those voices which have emphasised the fact that there are differences between these countries. These differences are clearly visible when we look, for example, at the details of their internal politics, and particularly at the way they approach civil liberties and human rights. These are values which for us as Europeans and as European politicians are important – not just economic cooperation, but concern for values which are dear to us and promotion of these values in relations with countries whose importance in the world is growing all the time. I agree with the conclusions and proposals contained in the report which say that we should develop a common strategy to govern relations with the BRICS in cooperation with our partners who share the same system of values, such as the United States.

Finally, I would definitely like to add my voice to the proposals which say that the European Parliament should have greater influence on formulating policy and on shared strategies, and should participate in summits between the European Union and its strategic partners, including those countries which today we call the BRICS.</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, on his work and on incorporating the suggestions made by me and my group.

The emergence of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) provides new opportunities for the European Union, but also major challenges in achieving its aim of contributing to a global order based on the rule of law, on universal human rights and on sustainable development, in order to achieve peace and security for all.

By investing in connections with the BRICS in the various forums, including the G7, G8 and G20, the European Union may find valuable allies in piecing together the global financial regulation and economic governance that humanity so needs, as the current crisis has shown with its destructive impact across the world.

However, this assumes that the EU is able to develop special partnerships, with different geometry for each of the BRICS, taking into account their history, the characteristics of their civilisations and their alliances, but also their lack of cohesion and clear differences. Sometimes the BRICS may take a foreign policy line that jars with that of the EU, as happened in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) last year, in the vote on UNSC Resolution 1973 on Libya; there, however, a Member State also dissented, unfortunately.

In such situations, it is up to the EU to use all its ingenuity and diplomatic tools to make each of the BRICS see that it is also in its interests to contribute towards strengthening a coherent international order which both shows and receives respect. It is clear that, if the EU engages in the reform and enlargement of the UNSC, which it has not yet done, it will be better able to be heard among the BRICS that are candidates for permanent membership, namely Brazil, India and South Africa, without losing anything from Russia and China, which prefer the, although they do not have the courage to admit it. It falls to the EU to be able to show each of the BRICS that the more important they become internationally, the greater the responsibilities required of them in defending universal principles and values, and in a global order that ensures peace and justice for all.

Moreover, it is clear that there is an extraordinary potential in the BRICS whose societies are now genuine democracies and which have deep-rooted connections with European culture – such as Brazil, which shares its history, language, culture and many of the quirks of its people with Portugal, my country – for developing partnerships and cooperation in all areas, from trade to applied scientific development, industry, environmental and climate protection, renewable energy, combating poverty and promoting democracy.

It was no accident that, whilst in Cuba recently, President Rousseff recited the chorus of a Portuguese anti-fascist song: ‘’, meaning ‘it is the people who command’.</literal>

  Mr President, later today we will be discussing the own-initiative report of Sir Graham Watson on consistent policy towards regimes against which the EU applies restrictive measures.

I appreciate the growing economic importance of BRICS countries. However, the EU policy towards them must take into account the principles that have been outlined in Sir Graham’s report. European values must always take precedence over economic interests. The common values referred to in Mr Saryusz-Wolski’s report are still in formation in these countries. The EU and the EEAS should make sure that constructive partnership with BRICS and other emerging powers brings about the spill-over of democracy, human rights, civil liberties, the rule of law and gender equality.

The future role of BRICS in the international arena should not be underestimated. If we cannot engage them positively, they might become extremely difficult competitors for the EU in economic terms while disregarding human values.</literal>

  –Mr President, I shall begin by congratulating the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Saryusz-Wolski, on drafting this report. I believe that it is an important element of setting out an EU foreign policy strategy, so I hope that the Commission and, in particular, the Vice-President/High Representative will be able incorporate the vision that the rapporteur has presented here into their strategy.

As a Portuguese Member, I particularly welcome the door being opened – although that is as far as it has gone – to the creation of a European Parliament delegation to Brazil, as it is incomprehensible that all of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) have their own delegation, except Brazil. This is interesting because it is the only country out of Brazil, Russia, India and China whose national language is a European language, and which has a clearly Western, Atlantic and European culture, giving it a unique affinity to us. It also has a key role as an example for the other BRICS in the area of human rights and, we might say, international action. It is also incomprehensible that Parliament, unlike the Commission and the Council, has not created a delegation for Brazil.

The Commission and the Council have an alliance, a strategic partnership with Brazil, but we in Parliament still do not have a delegation to Brazil – largely because of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – and cannot monitor Brazilian policies. We can monitor economic affairs in Mercosur, but we cannot monitor the international policy positions of Brazil because we do not have a dedicated delegation to the country. This is a total failure on the part of Parliament, and I hope that it will be rectified following the great vision shown the Saryusz-Wolski report.</literal>

  Mr President, the report we are now debating is strategic, comprehensive and sophisticated, addressing Europe’s challenge generated by the changing distribution of power within the international system: a process accelerated by the current world crisis.

Europe, which has created a modern international system, is now facing a double challenge. She has to keep her central place within it while having to fight a nasty internal crisis. In the past century, given Europe’s centrality within the international system, war in Europe has twice become world war. Today, even if war in Europe is unthinkable, our continent could still rock the world boat hard, both financially and economically.

The West – the US and Europe – now has to make room for the newcomers, either in existing bodies such as the UN Security Council or by creating new ones for them such as the G20. BRICS is a nascent grouping which is relatively heterogeneous, while Russia and China are well-established powers. There is a big question mark over the ambitions of Brazil and South Africa, with India apparently preoccupied primarily with China, which embodies this challenge. How can Europe best engage these emerging power centres without destroying the current world international institutional architecture? To engage this power successfully, Europe, which will have first to ensure coherence between the national and EU approaches towards them, will need to strike the right balance between change, namely permitting these emerging power centres to achieve their aims, and continuity, namely safeguarding her interests.</literal>

  –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the most visible aspect of the changes affecting Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS), which is also the most significant one in terms of consequences for the life of our societies, regards the economic and commercial penetration of these emerging powers. These changes may lead to stability and widespread prosperity, but appropriate speed is required, both in terms of responses in the international rules – and we know that unfortunately the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations are at a standstill – and in terms of greater integration of our foreign policy with trade policy, taking into account the fact that our foreign policy in some respects is unfortunately still in its infancy, while trade policy, thanks to the exclusive competences of the Treaty of Lisbon, is fully functional.

I am wondering, for example, what the role of trade attachés in our embassies is. These trade attachés are not part of the European External Action Service, but will play a key role in the BRICS countries, one that is as important, if not more so, as that of our diplomats.</literal>

  –Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to begin my speech by congratulating our colleague, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, on the excellent report that he has presented to us here. It is clear from the report that the world of today is seeing the rise of new countries to the status of powers, which I believe demands a new approach and position by the EU in order to address this phenomenon.

The so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) are countries with very diverse histories, cultures, societies and political systems. There is some geopolitical and historical conflict between them, and it is clear that they take onboard our fundamental values, such as democracy, freedom and respect for human rights, to varying degrees.

Without neglecting the other countries, I believe that we should strengthen our relations with those that not only nominally share those values, but also apply them in a consistent and committed way, such as Brazil. While it is true that the worlds of the Cold War and of the period of US dominance could coexist with an United Nations Security Council stripped of military, demographic and cultural representativeness, I have major doubts as to whether everything can continue as it is.

The idea of a global citizenship cannot cease to be made up of symbols and images from other countries. This is a valuable prerequisite in order for us to maintain the universality of Western values. We should give clear signals that we deserve the trust of our partners; that we do not just share values, but are willing to work together and give them a voice at global level, and to enable the interpretation of those who may be heard clearly.

As such, I would emphasise the historical role of my country, Portugal, in the development of Brazil’s language and its establishment there.</literal>

  Mr President, our report was not only political, it was also an intellectual challenge – an attempt to describe the current situation, to foresee future developments and, on that basis, to outline policy proposals for our relations with the BRICS countries.

It is time for us to wake up. In many cases the EU institutions and the European leaders still live in a world of the past that no longer exists. Our eurocentric views and approaches often lead to failures, or half successes, for us on the global scene. We need to catch up with reality. Baroness Ashton, you should take this report not as a criticism of you, but rather as a call for action.

However, I would like to warn against attempts to simplify the picture and to regard the BRICS countries as a kind of unified political bloc. Indeed, we have no interest in seeing them move closer to one another to create a counterweight to the EU that will not necessarily be based on the principles and values we find important. That is why I would recommend an intensification of bilateral relations without artificially pushing these countries towards greater cohesion.

The European Parliament can play an important role here. Parliamentary cooperation with some of these countries is producing good results. Others seem to be less interested, but that should not discourage us. A good step would be for the European Parliament to be invited to participate in bilateral summits.

As regards Brazil, I am one of those who very much supported the establishment of a bilateral parliamentary cooperation committee and I am sure that this will be a reality as of 2014. By the way, the amendment which mentions this possibility in the report was introduced by the S&amp;D Group, and specifically by Ana Gomes.</literal>

As Brazil’s main trading partner, the European Union generates no less than 22.2% of its total trade. I believe that the European Union and Brazil can, and should, cooperate more extensively, including with regard to supplementing the volume of commercial transactions, particularly following the joint action plan for the period up to 2014, and specifically in acquiring a leading role in international forums on topics such as climate change, economic governance and, last but not least, human rights.</literal>

As a member of the European Parliament delegations for relations with Mercosur and India, I emphasise the importance of the EU-Mercosur association agreement, which will be the most important association agreement ever signed by the European Union and which is aimed at trade worth USD 125 billion annually. I would also like to emphasise Brazil’s role as a main actor in the Mercosur region, and welcome the renewal of the EU-Brazil strategic partnership, the Joint Action Plan 2012-2014. We regret that the EU-Brazil agreement on air transport was not signed at the EU-Brazil summit in October 2011.

I support those who say that these relationships must be built primarily on the basis of bilateral economic agreements, which should be very clearly prioritised, with regard to the heterogeneity of these countries, their global expansion and their varying products. However, the main emphasis, in my opinion, should be on supporting and constructing economic and social structures in these countries so that they do not circumvent, so to speak, the rights of workers to protection from health problems and injuries at work.</literal>

               Mr President, first let me thank Lady Ashton for the openness with which she has received the report, which calls for more action, as somebody has rightly said. I would also like to thank my colleagues, who understood the message and contributed to the richness of this report.

I am happy because what has a name exists. It is named – the phenomenon has been named, so it does exist. So we should treat this report as an early notification – not a warning – about forthcoming challenges.

I did not deny in this report that there are huge differences between them, but I tried to extract the tiny part which is common to them, even if it is only 1% of the picture and even if it is only restricted to issues on which they have similar positions and act as an entity and foreign policy in the making.

You said, Lady Ashton, that we should avoid a ‘West versus the rest’ confrontation. This is also my dream, but the world is not as we would wish. My comment would be ‘yes, but...’. In some cases, we see that democracies there – India and Brazil – were seduced by autocracies regarding their common positions, and regarding human rights and democracy (and I see the convergence with the Watson report), Libya, Syria, the Ivory Coast and Sudan. In some cases they were jointly challenging the current system of international governance.

The question of the EU voice in the UN was an appalling and most regrettable case. Having strategic partners (as we call them with all due respect) means having reliable partners sharing values. Very often they neither share nor practice our values.

In the policy towards the BRICS we should avoid the creation of coalitions of the lowest common denominator on democracy and human rights. Our policy should be inclusive, in order to involve them in the system of governance – but on the basis of universal values. They should be our partners and not our opponents, as has happened in the past. In the EU we should think strategically. In 2050 they will be immensely bigger than we are. Let us be prepared. The EU has to act together under your leadership, Lady Ashton, to avoid Member States’ divergent policies, for example on Libya. Regarding Libya, BRICS were more united than the Union itself. We need strong European foreign policy.</literal>

               –As mentioned in this initiative, the forthcoming EU-Mercosur Association Agreement will be the most important association agreement ever signed by the EU, encompassing 750 million people and trade worth USD 125 billion per year. On 8 November 2011, in a discussion with the Commissioner and ministers for agriculture, I had the opportunity to question the Commissioner about the responses that the new agricultural policy would provide, so that producers might successfully address the competition problems that the agreement with Mercosur would mean for them. At that point the Commission suggested that the answer to this problem was the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. However, the answer should have been defending European agriculture in the agreement, and not tabling this inappropriate proposal. I believe that this proposal is far from being the answer that farmers need to their real problems if they are to tackle the potential consequences for them of an agreement that does not protect the interests of European agriculture. This also raises questions as to whether this is not a ready yet clumsy way of legitimising negotiations that do not protect our agriculture.</literal>

               –In order for the BRICS countries and other emerging powers to play an increasingly important global role in foreign policy, their economic growth needs to continue and increase. As the current economic crisis shows, there is a strong degree of interdependence between emerged and emerging powers. Indeed, the economic growth and welfare of the former is a definite prerequisite for the consolidation of the latter’s economic growth. In light of this, the EU needs to act as a single, robust political and economic entity in order to continue to promote universal values in the new multi-polar system of global governance. However, a great deal of attention must be focused on the trend towards excessive regulation of the financial market, which will only result in the migration of capital to BRICS countries with fair regulations. This development has a particularly serious impact, starting with the increase in financing costs for European companies and ending with the loss of their competitiveness. Transnational challenges such as climate change, global regulatory issues, access to raw materials and rare elements, terrorism, sustainable development, political stability and global security will require an approach based on common values, consensus, consultation and close cooperation with the new emerging powers.</literal>

We have to be aware of our place in the world and the importance of our relationship with other actors. The report points out that BRICS have shown regional integration capacity and hence the capacity to engage in multipolar governance systems. There is a potential interest of the BRICS in contributing to global governance. What I want to point out is that opportunities for collaboration can appear in investments, exchange of experience, technology and research partnerships in major projects.</literal>

               –Formulating EU policy towards the states referred to by the acronym BRICS is a particularly difficult task. This is because on the one hand they are countries which are enjoying rapid economic development, while on the other hand it should be remembered that over 70% of the world’s poorest people live in middle-income countries. There is no doubt that the BRICS countries differ from the EU’s Member States not just in terms of economic indicators, but also in terms of values which we consider to be universal and inalienable.

The policy of the EU and the Member States towards the BRICS should also have the support of our citizens. To support something, it is first necessary to understand it. I fear many Europeans do not understand why China is the recipient of relatively high levels of official development assistance from Europe. This really is difficult to justify or rationalise.

I am convinced that EU political strategy towards the BRICS should revolve around consistent building of shared standards, which will reduce differences both in the area of competitiveness and in relation to values. We will not achieve this objective by unilaterally raising standards in the EU. I am thinking, for example, of plans to reduce COemissions. Everyone who knows at least a little about the BRICS knows very well that at the moment these countries do not have the least intention of restricting their development. Changing this attitude is a serious challenge for the EU.</literal>

               The largest EU states have long suffered from a belief in their own uniqueness, size, importance and key position in the world. This is also understood by the author of the own initiative report, and virtually the entire report is concerned with the possibility of avoiding, for example, the danger of the BRIC countries becoming a key force in the world, regardless of the interests of key EU states and the US. It is clear from certain passages that, on the one hand, there will be an attempt at various EU levels to unify viewpoints as much as possible, not just in foreign policy but also in other areas, so that the EU can act as a unified and sufficiently large partner. On the other hand, negotiations will be conducted individually with individual BRICS countries in order to eliminate the danger of them taking a unified approach. The Committee on Development has understood that cooperation in the area of the environment, regional cooperation and introduction of systems to reduce social inequality (item 1 of the Opinion of the Committee mentions ‘efficient tax and social protection systems’) means a departure from today’s neoliberal capitalism in favour of something else. Not even the Committee on Development dared call this socialism, but the Committee members apparently understood this. It is, anyway, only dialogue with the strongest and fastest growing countries in the world that will make possible the full involvement of the EU and US in a future new world order. Panic is inappropriate, and we must treat the BRIC countries as fully-fledged partners.</literal>

               Until recent times, Europe’s diplomatic efforts were mainly turned towards the US and other industrialised countries. Nowadays, globalisation and the emergence of the BRICS as major exporters on international markets are the driving forces behind the industrialised countries’ loss of global market shares. This has brought the EU to reconsider its foreign policy towards these countries which have gained colossal power on the international political chessboard. Nevertheless, the approach on how to reshape our foreign policy towards the BRICS is, in my opinion, too often based on the fear of industrial competition, especially in the case of China. As a matter of fact, if all BRICS present common challenging features, such as a prominent land size, a large population, a rapid economic growth, they also provide formidable opportunities for the EU’s market in the fields of exports. That is why our foreign policy should be built on the grounds of these positive prospects as opposed to dreading irreversible rivalry.</literal>

               .Mr President, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs on this recommendation. It may bear my name, but it is the result of collective effort on a cross-party basis.

One of the most important tools we have in our foreign policy toolkit is that of the sanction or restrictive measure, and this report aims to make our current policies on restrictive measures coherent and consistent. It recommends that all external restrictive measures be matched by an equivalent approach towards the activities of authoritarian leaders when they come within the Union’s borders. By allowing them to act with impunity within our borders as we currently do, we undermine our foreign policy, and yet we currently allow them to shield their often dubiously-acquired gains within our banking systems. We offer them the incentive and the capacity to continue with corruption and the exploitation of their people and their resources.

The main focus of this report is to advocate a consistent approach to authoritarian leaders that is in tune with our values and visions. We recommend updating our policies to make them more proportionate, more targeted and more humane, and to use the new tools given us in the Treaty of Lisbon to create a multi-instrument strategy to be coherent and effective. It seeks to prohibit them from holding financial and material assets within our borders, commits us to a more rigorous adherence of travel bans so that they cannot travel within our borders for non-humanitarian purposes, and asks Member States to prosecute those within the EU suspected of assisting them in circumventing sanctions policy.</literal>

  Mr President, I consider this report to be extremely timely, particularly given the restrictive measures recently adopted against Iran. The European Parliament should continuously maintain a high-level debate on the very idea of restrictive measures and their effectiveness or ineffectiveness in achieving the EU’s fundamental objectives of international stability, peace and democracy.

Firstly, the report recommends that the Council develop clear criteria for when restrictive measures are to be applied, and objectives for such measures. In the case of the embargo on Iran, this is exactly what we need.

Secondly, the report is very explicit about the prerequisite that sanctions should not harm the population. This also is important in the case of Iran. The last thing we need is for the Iranian people to consider the EU its enemy.

Finally, I would like to point out that a coherent policy within the EU’s borders is a necessity. I have heard today from a lecturer who contacted the Delegation for relations with Iran to say that he has had EUR 900 frozen by the Bank of Austria, while the Maltese Times has got in touch with me to say that Iran has EUR 2 billion invested in Malta which is not going to be frozen.</literal>

  –Mr President, the imposition of sanctions is a unilateral decision that destroys the space that could and should be used for dialogue, negotiation and diplomatic mediation. It is a decision based on imposing the will of the strongest. As so often happens, strength has triumphed over reason instead of reason triumphing over strength. Combining the imposition of sanctions with direct meddling in the internal affairs of a country by taking part in conflicts and supporting one of the parties in a conflict against others constitutes an unacceptable act of intervention. There are many sad examples of outside intervention by powers, leading to change in the political power of a country so that it is to their liking, by promoting interlocutors willing to accommodate their imperialist ambitions.

Change in the political power of a country should come about as a result of its people exercising their sovereign will, not from external impositions that later demand that these changes meet their interests. What is therefore needed – I am concluding, Mr President – is total compliance with international law, the United Nations Charter and the principles contained therein. Unfortunately, this report does not take that view.</literal>

  Mr President, in order to be successful in using restrictive measures, we need to enhance the consistency, transparency and credibility of their application. Coordinated action in the case of Iran or Syria shows that, if it is to be effective, all Member States should ensure they have the same policies and uniform sanctions towards these regimes. Restrictive measures, if used cautiously, should play an important role. We need to be careful to use the measures in such a way that they do not harm the general population or the development of civil society, which could help in the processes of change.

I think that the assets of representatives of regimes that have been frozen in the EU as a result of the sanctions should be streamed to the development of civil society in those countries. That would certainly be the most helpful thing.</literal>

               Mr President, I would like to join all the Members who have spoken on the issue of a unified approach towards regimes that limit the freedoms of their inhabitants in a restrictive way. It is good for us to have a genuinely consistent, unified approach in our foreign policy to all such regime representatives, so that these people cannot conceal their assets in banks on EU soil, for example, and so that their assets can be frozen in banks in the EU, where circumstances so require. They should also not be allowed to travel in the EU, except for humanitarian reasons, and that would probably be on an exceptional basis.

We must therefore have clear and unified criteria to apply. A typical example might be Iran, where we have already adopted certain precise rules.</literal>

               There is no doubt that in normal circumstances a consistent policy is admirable. Indeed when restrictive measures are applied against regimes it should be understandable that a consistent policy should be applied to leaders of such regimes in the exercise of commercial and personal interests. On the other hand one must, first of all, discuss whether the restrictive measures against regimes themselves should be consistent. The level and type of restrictive measures against regimes do vary according to particular circumstances. Similarly targeted measures against leaders of such regimes do in fact vary. It is inevitable that a certain amount of flexibility exists given the diverse approaches which the EU adopts vis-à-vis not only regimes but also countries which have not adopted democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law. The EU is still in transition. From commercial clout we are endeavouring to establish political presence. In times of transition one has to be realistic and allow flexibility.</literal>

               -I fully support the practical advantages in the form of collective compensation brought to European consumers who have suffered damages, as against the individual resolution of legal disputes in the EU. In my opinion, Member States should do more to support the mass approach to justice, introduce alternative dispute resolution centres and support instruments implementing their powers. In my opinion, it is also important, given the current growing volume of disputes of a cross-border nature, to create a cross-border mechanism giving consumers the possibility of applying to whichever entity is closest within the territory of the EU. This measure is of fundamental importance, for example, in implementing compensation for air passengers in the event of an airline going bankrupt. Compensation systems that are by nature more effective, less costly and less time-consuming offer a unique chance to consumers who have suffered damages.</literal>

               –Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Ms Vassiliou, my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education and the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for the fruitful work we have done together over the past few months.

Today the sports world is mourning those who died at a football match in Egypt. I would like to express my strong condemnation, and to remember the victims and their families.

While drawing up this report I was in constant contact with the sports world, hearing people’s concerns and trying to reflect the issues on which the EU is being asked to express its opinion.

The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has caused a revolution in the sports world because, for the first time, it was given its own legal basis, in Article 165. The first response to the Treaty was the Commission communication entitled ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, which follows the guidelines set out in the 2007 White Paper. Parliament responded with an own-initiative report of the same name. The report was approved by the Committee on Culture and Education by 28 votes in favour and 2 votes against.

I would like to highlight two concepts related to sport, of which I was very aware when writing the report. Firstly, the principle of subsidiarity, which recognises the competences of Member States and, secondly, the concept of the specific nature of sport, as mentioned in Article 165. However, this is not a universal principle, but rather one that must be analysed and approved on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the autonomy of governance structures in sport should be respected as a fundamental principle for its organisation.

Allow me to briefly highlight some points made in the report. First of all, volunteering, when thousands of citizens selflessly take part to ensure that countless sporting events can be held. We must give them our unconditional support.

Secondly, doping. Doping substances are a blight on sport and society. We should educate people on prevention, convict traffickers, pursue cheats and harmonise sanctions between sports law and civil law, maintaining the greatest possible respect for sportspeople. The report urges Member States to treat trafficking in illegal substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs and to adopt national legislation to this end.

It is vital to support the practice of sport in schools, and we therefore call for sport to be part of their curriculum.

At some point, sportspeople’s professional careers come to an end, and during their career they need to have access to high-quality academic training in order to later become integrated into the world of work.

Unfortunately, racism, xenophobia and homophobia are present in sport, and it is therefore necessary to implement new measures to eliminate any signs of those threats at sporting events.

I would like to stress the undeniable benefit that sport has on people’s health, leading to a significant reduction in public health spending. I would also highlight the importance of sport as a means of integration for the most vulnerable groups, such as immigrants and socially excluded groups, as well as for those with disabilities.

Betting should be protected from unauthorised activities, and from suspected match fixing, in particular by recognising organisers’ property rights with regard to their competitions. The report also calls on Member States to take legal action against sports fraud.

It is fundamentally important that commercial exploitation of audiovisual rights for sport competitions should be carried out on a centralised, territorial basis with a view to guaranteeing that revenues are distributed fairly between elite and mass-participation sport.

I would like to draw attention to the proposal to establish a European Day of Sports and an Erasmus Sports Programme, and to protect indigenous sports as part of our cultural heritage.

These are just a few of the issues dealt with in the report, and I hope I can count on Parliament’s support.</literal>

The most important thing for me in presenting the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was to emphasise that sport makes an important contribution to the economy, alongside its well-known health and social benefits.

I am sure that we can generate added value in this area at a European level. However, I believe that the subsidiarity principle should continue to play a central role in sport. Sport must remain close to the people. This works most effectively when it is organised on a national, regional and local level. Over and above the points mentioned, the European Union should restrict itself to establishing a suitable legal framework. This applies, for example, to the public funding of sport, competition rules and also competitions and usage rights. Therefore, I welcome the fact that these considerations have been included in the report and I can give the text my full support.</literal>

               –Mr President, maybe I could make full use of the three minutes, then, in order to use the time allotted to my two absent colleagues.

I would like to thank Mr Fisas Ayxela for his report. I do find it particularly sad, however, that an amendment that has been adopted by both the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, namely concerning a dialogue between the Commission and professional sports organisations, was not adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education. That means that we are denying that professional sports need to comply with economic legislation within Europe and that – when it comes to European competitions – there is still inadequate equality.

We see minimum ages for sports contracts, which is not a good thing. We see that there are enormous differences in how professional sports are treated when it comes to taxation. We see a great many cases that contradict one another. It is therefore necessary for the Commission to enter into dialogue with the professional sports organisations in order to ensure that professional sports fall into line so that, in future, we can benefit enormously from these sports and so that our young people learn from them. That is what I am calling for.

In other regards, I endorse the content of Mr Fisas Ayxela’s report, but I believe it is a pity that the opinion of the Committees on Legal Affairs and on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection were not incorporated.</literal>

               –Mr President, sport is the most important side issue for millions of Europeans. Sport holds a mirror to our society on a daily basis.

It is now up to the EU to launch a sound European sports policy and tackle abuses. Unfortunately it seems from the Commission’s proposals and the conclusions of the Sports Council that good intentions are not going to be followed up with concrete action in order to effectively tackle these abuses.

Thus, in 2010, as many as 1100 young people were transferred in football using an exception. A complete ban is needed in order to protect these young people. An end also needs to be put to dicey practices by dishonest players’ agents by means of a registration system with job specifications, a code of conduct, mechanisms for punishment and a European blacklist.

Recently, Europe has been plagued by racist incidents in sport. The EU needs to show greater leadership and to demonstrate that it takes its own motto – ‘Unity in diversity’ – seriously by putting in place legislation that prohibits discrimination in the workplace. It needs to set up effective campaigns in order to make clear that discrimination is unacceptable. This is enormously important in these days of rampant populism and right-wing extremism.

Criminals on or alongside the sports field work across borders. That means that we need to tackle them at that level. Sporting fraud needs to be incorporated into the criminal law of every Member State. Europe needs to make clear to sporting organisations that cooperation with Europol and Eurojust is absolutely necessary.

To sum up, a European sports policy is desperately needed and can act as an example. As it stands, the initial proposals for a new sports policy have been too non-committal. Fair play and fraternity on the sports field are still the most important goal, but that is only possible with a strong sports policy.</literal>

               . –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to renew my best wishes and my compliments to the President for his new position.

I wanted to thank our rapporteur, Mr Fisas Ayxela, for doing an excellent job: it is a really comprehensive report which sends out an important signal in the field of sport. The rapporteur has worked well, including with all the shadow rapporteurs, and of course I thank them too for the result. Finally, I also wish to send my greetings to Commissioner Vassiliou.

Moreover, it really is a good sign that we are holding this debate and have completed this report in the year when the Olympics will be taking place, the crowning moment for sport worldwide, a time when sport turns into a vehicle for the global exchange of values and friendship. For this reason, we have stressed that sport is a tool for combating discrimination, bearing in mind how difficult it still is, for example, for women to play sports in some countries, such as Iran, which therefore worries us not only because of its decisions on nuclear power.

Another significant factor is the idea of supporting the designation of a European capital of sport under the leadership of ACES, the European Capitals of Sport Association. As we have learnt from the European Capitals of Culture, the promotion of activities for the young and old is at its height under such initiatives. The report also includes the fight against doping, a focus on gambling and the rediscovery of traditional games.

I think, in short, that we have done a good job in terms of honouring as far as possible the EU’s new competence in sport under the Treaty of Lisbon.</literal>

               . – (Mr President, I too wish to thank the rapporteur Santiago Fisas because his starting point from the outset has been the notion of consensus. We have discussed each paragraph separately and sought to ensure that every political group features in this report, and that it is a report which does not contain any differences of opinion but, if anything, includes everyone’s views. This is where credit goes to Santiago Fisas because he managed to get us all to sing from the same hymn sheet. However, given how important sport is in the European Union, hundreds of amendments were tabled. Once again, particular credit is due to the rapporteur in that the report itself provides more than just a detailed analysis of sport in the European Union. This report has not been confined only to depicting the current state of sport in the European Union. On the contrary, it contains innovative sections and ideas, as well as bold ideas which we supported and debated, while some were removed and others remained in the draft. It is of paramount importance that sensitive subjects were dealt with, such as the status of minors involved in sport, betting on sport, and so on.

We are all aware, and we have also seen the opinion from the specialist committees, that sport is much more than a recreational activity. It has extremely important implications for health, education, reducing violence, the economy and so on, as well as for increasing productivity and for every factor signifying a stable, dynamic economy in the future. As a result, I believe that allocating only 1% of the budget to the ‘Erasmus for All’ programme is far too little for sport, given the implications that sport has in the European Union. This is why I say that we need to campaign for more money for sport.</literal>

               Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and his inclusive approach to this report.

The report has drawn attention from across a wide interest spectrum: from athletes, volunteers, sporting organisations and the media. Sport is intrinsic to the lives of European citizens, it crosses social divides and borders, it unites people and it enriches our lives. A European sports policy is not about harmonisation, it is not about taking the soul of competition out of sport and it should not be narrowed down to a debate on the presence of the EU flag. The compromise text is flexible and it remains up to sporting organisations and Member States to decide.

The excellent recommendations in this report on supporting volunteers, strengthening and improving access to training, education for coaches and athletes, promoting traditional sports, eliminating doping and tackling corruption in sport should not be overshadowed. This is a report that provides us with a strong framework for creating a European sports policy based on social inclusion and enhancing sport in Europe.

As an MEP from a Member State that boasts the world’s largest amateur and volunteer sporting organisation – that is the Gaelic Athletic Association, with one million amateur members – I am pleased that this report has acknowledged the important role which volunteers play. There are 35 million amateurs involved in sporting organisations in Europe. The role of volunteers and amateurs is central to the continued success of sporting organisations in every community, and that is why it is essential that the Commission allocates a budget to sports policy. Sport is a vehicle that delivers on broader EU aims across several policy areas, such as Community development, active ageing and healthy and active living. It has a successful economic dimension and it is a social phenomenon that delivers an invaluable public good.

Finally I would like to highlight the importance of the right of journalists to access and report on sporting events. There is public appetite for sports news and we must be sure to safeguard the right of the public to obtain and receive independent news and information on sporting events.</literal>

               Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Fisas Ayxela and the authors of the opinions on their excellent work.

Our political group welcomes the EU-level action in the field of sport being mentioned in the Commission’s communication. We also support the proposals included in Parliament’s motion for a resolution. In particular we are fully satisfied that the report voices the concern regarding support for traditional sport and games as an important part of our diverse cultural heritage. Member States should take measures to protect them, since some traditional games and sports are in danger of disappearing.

The main matters of concern are some social aspects of the life of professional sportsmen and women, many of whom face an uncertain future at the end of their sporting careers. This problem was outlined especially by the leaders of the Latvian Trade Union of Sport and Tourism during our discussions on the subject. Europe should promote its social model and improve social standards concerning such a specific category of employees as professional athletes. I hope the appeal to the Member States to consider ways of alleviating the financial burden on the lowest-paid professional sportspersons will be acknowledged. Nevertheless, the implementation of a common European definition of the procedure and determination of terms for professional athletes and coaches retiring is welcomed.

Therefore we support the suggestion in the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs to call on the Commission to initiate a dialogue with all EU professional sports organisations on how to tackle problems arising from differences in the Member States regarding employment contracts.</literal>

               Mr President, there is no doubt that sport has an important place in Europe. Not only does it generate billions of euros and many thousands of jobs, but it also provides health and joy to millions. I am passionate about sport myself.

Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament’s new supporting competence in sport should have provided it with the opportunity to explore ways the EU could help grassroots sport through volunteering initiatives and community sports development etc., but sadly this report misses the opportunity. It has turned into a matter of how the EU can take advantage of the popularity of professional sport – what sport can do for the EU instead of what the EU can do for sport.

The report focuses mainly on professional football. It takes little account of minority or grassroots sport – where I believe the focus should have been. The EU can have a role in influencing some aspects of sport – the fight against doping and cross-border gambling etc., but the report goes much too far in calling for the EU itself, rather than individual Member States, to sign up to WADA and to doping conventions.

The report also ignores the limits of EU power by proposing special tax regimes and impinging on the right of Member States to decide on their educational curricula, and touches on social security provisions. All of these are in the realm of the Member State and not of the EU. But most damaging is the attempt to make national sports teams wear the EU flag on their shirts and to fly the EU flag at all sporting events. At first this was compulsory and now it is voluntary, but the proposal to have the EU flag on national teams is still outrageous and unnecessary.

Sport has a very special place in the United Kingdom, and our national sports teams form a key part of our identities and our heritage. The EU is trying to impose an artificial European identity on us by forcing our athletes to wear its emblem. Does this add value to sport? No it does not. It is simply an attempt to add value to the EU itself.

               –Mr President, on a European scale, sport, like many other activities, particularly group activities, has long been seen solely in terms of competition and regarded as a simple economic activity.

This report finally recognises that sport, and the wider range of physical and sporting activities, has educational, cultural, health and social – or societal – dimensions. It emphasises the role of volunteers and the importance of studying the feasibility of a suitable legal and tax framework. How could we be anything but glad about that?

It underlines the importance of developing and, therefore, of investing in grassroots sport, as well as the need to redistribute investments between professional sport and grassroots sport.

We should like to highlight the importance of public funding, the only means to truly guarantee equality of access without discrimination, and the need for real partnership with the sports movement. The Member States obviously have a major role to play, including establishing respect for ethics in sports and guaranteeing the health of sportspeople, be they amateurs or professionals.

Nonetheless, I have some regrets as to the inadequacy of the regulatory role of the Member States with regard to the abuse occurring in this sector. One example is that of online games and sports betting. We put forward a proposal reaffirming the need for a monopoly by the Member States in this area, in accordance with the ECJ ruling of 8 September 2009. Unfortunately, it was not accepted.

We would have also liked to see more encouragement for States to guarantee the economic and social rights of sportspeople, particularly in terms of training and the right to retraining.

However, words are not enough. We need action. The prism of the internal market and competition needs to be returned to its rightful place, and physical activity and sport need to be recognised for what they are, that is, an excellent tool for individual and collective freedom.</literal>

               Mr President, paragraph 100 of this report clearly states that you would like to see the EU flag at major sporting events and on the jerseys of athletes. Are we now going to see the EU flag at the British Olympics, at the Champions League Final or even on the shirt of the England captain? This is nothing more than sheer EU propaganda and vanity. The EU has never been so unpopular, yet here you are, wanting to stamp your flag on sporting stars in the hope that you can force the people to love you. But they will not.

What you propose also seems to break the rules of sporting competitions. For example, under Law 4, Decision 1 of the FIFA laws of the game, it states: ‘The team of a player whose basic compulsory equipment has political slogans or statements will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or FIFA.’ What right do you think the EU has to interfere in sport in such a way to encourage countries to break the rules? It is hypocritical, because the EU is in effect a political organisation. You even say in paragraph 20 of the report that political propaganda should be banned, which is hypocritical. Athletes proudly wear the flag of their own national countries. They should not wear the flag of the European Union.</literal>

  –Mr President, the report on the European dimension in sport is of particular importance to society. Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) covers the EU’s new responsibility in the field of sport. The importance of sport for our society in areas such as promoting health, encouraging tolerance, stimulating the economy and tourism and developing organisations is very clear in the area where I come from, the state of Salzburg. Sporting activities are a permanent feature in the lives of almost every family, both in summer and in winter. This report also seems particularly important to me with regard to the significance of sport for older people and with regard to the call for women to be better represented on the decision-making bodies in sport.

Doping and corruption in sport and the constructive proposals to resolve these problems will hopefully only be mentioned on this one occasion. We hope that there will soon be an improvement in this area. I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have always been convinced that sport plays a vital educational role. By emphasising educational and cultural values, sport is at one and the same time an instrument of integration, exchange of ideas and growth.

The goal must be to provide greater uniformity and at the same time guarantee the availability of sports for all European citizens, without discrimination of any kind. It cannot therefore be confined within a single State, but applies across all Member States of the European Union as a single entity.

The European Union must intervene at a time when sport is undergoing an acute and persistent crisis, especially due to the criminal activities connected with it. The scandals associated with betting agencies or match fixing spring to mind.

In light of these considerations it is necessary and desirable for the European institutions to monitor the world of sports more closely, in order to curb any excesses that may arise. Detailed and enforceable rules would help to improve the standard of sports governance. Therefore, the priority is to intervene to regulate the activities of sports agents and player transfers, as well as to combat fraud and doping, as recommended by the rapporteur.</literal>

  Mr President, the debate this evening has pooled many valid and crucial reasons for the Commission to up its game and back sport more effectively in the EU. I come at this debate from a different angle, as a former mental health professional of 25 years. The psychological benefits of regular sport are understated yet unquestionable. Exercise converts adrenaline into energy and is a primary creator of endorphins. Exercise advances self-confidence and can afford someone a new lease of life. The many and varied benefits of sport are, I hope, fully understood by the Commission following today’s debate, and I look forward to progress in this area.</literal>

               Mr President, firstly I wish to congratulate you on being elected President. I am pleased that we have a President who is keen on sports in Parliament, even if it is just for a while. I also wish to thank Mr Fisas Ayxela for an excellent report, and, likewise, the Commissioner, who has done an excellent job in the Commission in the area of sport. It is of course true that sport is Europe’s biggest popular movement. It needs to be spoken about, and it is important that we also stake out a clear role for it in the European Union.

Now that a legal basis has been established, it is important that we move towards real solutions. This report provides excellent guidance on what is achieved through sport, because we know its effects on health, and we know its other social effects in terms both of well-being and integrating people society. We also know how sport is important when we are fighting against racism and many other unpleasant phenomena at European level.

It is also important to ensure that there is funding. In this connection, I would like to say that I obviously hope that there will be adequate funds in the budgetary framework for sport, allowing us to reach its grassroots. However, it is also important to protect national monopolies. Veikkaus, the Finnish national lottery and sports betting company, is a good example of how to fund activities at grassroots level. It will need to remain.

Finally, I wish to say something about this issue of the EU flag, which the British Tories have made so much of. Surely it does not bother anyone now if the flag occasionally flies in the European Union. I am sure, besides, that it does not have to be used for team strips. However, perhaps the biggest piece of news for me today was when Mr Nuttall, talking about football, said that countries should support the idea that Great Britain will one day play as its own single team, under the flag of one Great Britain. I have to say that this is an unexpected point of view, and I think that it is a very welcome one.</literal>

  Mr President, may I too congratulate you on your election.

Being British, I understand the important role that sport plays in our lives. What I do not understand is why the EU should be meddling in the business of sport. The EU should focus on growth, jobs and the single market.

This report has been through seven committees and I have shadowed it on behalf of the ECR Group in two of them. I had intended to talk today about the British women who are sporting heroes to millions, such as Rebecca Adlington, Kelly Holmes and Paula Radcliffe. I wanted to talk to you today about how excited my home constituency of London is to welcome the world’s Olympic and Paralympics athletes later this year. But I cannot. Because I have to use this speech to denounce this report’s calls to fly EU flags at major sporting events and for the flag to be displayed on athletes’ clothing. I must also condemn the proposals to waste money on the European capital of sport at this time of austerity. The Brussels bubble needs to remember that we live in hard times.</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Fisas Ayxela very much for this important report, on which he worked for over a year. It is a report which may result in major changes in the new sports policy. It is a report for which millions of people involved in sport and thousands of organisations have been waiting for a long time. I would like to express my thanks for Mr Fisas Ayxela’s prodigious and outstanding piece of work.

The fact is that the shape of sports policy in the coming years is going to depend on us, on Parliament, but also on Ms Vassiliou, and on the extent to which the important proposals included in the report are actually put into practice. I think that keeping the three elements of the social role of sport, the economic dimension and the whole organisation of sport is absolutely right.

I would like to concentrate on several extremely important factors which it will finally be possible to correct or improve by means of European sports policy. There is the question of the regulation of sports agents and the transparency of the system – the whole system – the aim of which is to identify young talent. There is also the question, which you wrote about in the report, Mr Fisas Ayxela, of minimum qualifications for the important and responsible profession of sports agent. There is the whole area of the package for funding fair play in sport, which is extremely important in particular from the point of view of the system for training and identifying young talent. There is the question of the whole problem in sport related to match-fixing, to which we must react at EU level, because this procedure often even has links with organised crime. There is the question of the huge influence of sports tourism.

I would like to say that we still face, in fact, and the Commissioner still faces, the question of making the best use of structural funds, and in particular the European Social Fund, so as to improve the sports base but also to give all sportspeople who end their career the opportunity to become professionals who, thanks to the fund, can pass on their sporting knowledge. Finally, I would like to say that what makes the report is so good is that it has come in an Olympic Games year and the year of the Euro 2012 football championship, so I hope it will be very well received by the Member States.</literal>

               Mr President, I would like to support the motion for a resolution and the opinion of the Committee on the social role of sport. I am in favour of sport being a compulsory subject at all levels of schooling, but I am also in favour of all school sports grounds serving the wider public outside school hours.

Sport has huge potential for improving overall health at any age. Sport can be a means of integrating socially excluded people and eliminating all forms of discrimination. Giving priority to inter-generational sports can take many forms with benefits for public health, and with social, cultural and economic benefits for society. Sport is also a good way for young people to use their free time and to avoid drugs, violence and other negative phenomena.

However, as a woman – and a former active sportswoman – I expect more support for women in sport, the provision of equal access and adoption of measures in the area of equal opportunities.</literal>

  –Mr President, firstly I would like to offer my condolences for tonight’s tragedy in Egypt.

As regards this report, I must say that I am delighted to take part in the debate, particularly since I have been involved with sport my whole life: as a player, as President of the Gaelic Athletic Association and as Executive Chairman of the Irish Institute of Sport. We now have a report that allows us to implement Article 165 of the Treaty of Lisbon. I commend Santiago Fisas Ayxela and everyone else who helped compile this report.

I am very pleased with the report, particularly as some amendments that I tabled have been taken on board, especially in relation to grassroots sport, which gives effect to the written declaration that the Members so kindly passed here last year. Also the possibility of growth in sports tourism, and the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund to be used to develop infrastructure in sport, particularly in indigenous sports, of which the GAA, as my colleague Liam Aylward mentioned, is a shining example in my country.

But as the Commissioner mentioned – and I was pleased to hear her mention it – the MFF and the budget are going to be crucial. One argument we can certainly put forward in this context is that sport implies, directly or indirectly, 15 million people contributing 3.6% of GDP in the European Union. There are many more arguments, but that certainly justifies a good sports budget.

There are other suggestions which I am very pleased about. I see nothing wrong, by the way, with the suggestion about the European flag; after all, where do you expect to fly the European flag – outside the European Union or inside it? That is one argument. Also the European Day of Sport and the European Capitals of Sport, which is a wonderful development (I have seen that in my own country as well recently), and the Erasmus for All programme. There are a lot of good suggestions, and with a good budget we will make a lot of progress.</literal>

  –Mr President, first of all, my congratulations to Mr Fisas Ayxela for this excellent report and the broad support that he managed to conjure up for it in Parliament.

From the point of view of community, social cohesion and health, sport has such obvious advantages that we cannot stand still any longer. In fact, it cannot be stressed highly enough and I believe that it is important that we should therefore also pave the way for measures that guarantee the integrity of sport to the maximum possible degree and beef up the fight against excesses and illegal practices.

In that regard, Mr President, Commissioner, I have a message for some of our eurosceptic British friends who, in the meantime, seem to have vanished from the Chamber. Look at what has happened in Egypt today, where dozens of fans have died in football violence. Look at what happened in Vienna today, where dozens of fans were arrested and found guilty by the courts as a result of violence in football stadia.

That, ladies and gentlemen, is why we need a European sports policy. I will quote verbatim from Mr Fisas Ayxela’s report, which calls on Member States ‘to refuse access to stadiums to supporters who have displayed violent or discriminatory behaviour’ and ‘to ensure that stadium bans remain in force for international matches’. That is what it says in the report. It is a hot topic at this point in time and that is why we do need this European sports policy and why, Commissioner, you will have our 100% backing.

A database to exchange information about hooligans guilty of violence and racism is something that I think would be much more efficient to organise at European level. As other Members have already said, the same also applies to combating doping, betting fraud and so on.

So, ladies and gentlemen, let us concentrate on that instead of spending the whole evening here spouting hot air about the possibility of displaying a European flag on T-shirts – a proposal that, by the way, Mr Kelly, I am 100% behind because it is indeed on a voluntary basis, with 100% observance of the principle of subsidiarity.</literal>

  -Mr President, sport is one of the few activities which blur distinctions between people, as it involves all citizens of the EU regardless of gender, ethnic origin, religion, age, nationality or social status. Regular sport undoubtedly contributes to a healthy lifestyle and boosts the overall health of EU citizens, and we therefore need more promotion of active sport, not only from health workers but also from political representatives.

For people with mental or physical disabilities, sport represents a special kind of activity, as it enables them to create new positive relationships with themselves and with their peers, assisting their integration and inclusion in society. Since sport fulfils both a social and an educational function - developing people’s sense of fair play, teamwork in a multicultural environment and a sense of belonging - we will support this report, as it contains many excellent ideas and initiatives, as well as a budget line for this joint task.</literal>

  –Mr President, as Vice-Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I should point out that sporting events help develop tourism in Europe. With this in mind, synergies between sport and tourism must be identified, especially through modernising collective infrastructures.

One example of synergy between regional development, sport, transport and tourism is the tourist potential offered by cycling. The EuroVelo project, which already has 14 routes in Europe covering more than 70 000 kilometres, is an example of making a contribution to positive values, promoting social integration, strengthening communities, health promotion and urban development. I should emphasise the importance of the cycle route extending along the whole course of the Danube in supporting the development of tourism in the Danube region. I must also stress the role played by local, regional and national authorities in developing the European dimension of sport, especially through devising urban mobility plans and allocating finances for developing the infrastructures required for sporting activities.</literal>

               Mr President, I would like to start by applauding the fact that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union gives the Commission the possibility of contributing to the development of sport both organisationally and financially. Modern society suffers from a lack of physical activity, which has an unfavourable effect on the health of our citizens, especially in the spread of obesity and associated health complications. We therefore need to see greater support for sport also as support for health, which will surely have positive consequences in terms of lower healthcare costs.

Promotion of a healthy, active way of life for our citizens, with a greater number of sporting activities, should be one of the EU’s main priorities in this area. Another important priority should be support for a European framework of sporting competitions in individual kinds of sport, in order to bring people together on the basis of common interests. I firmly believe that well-organised support for sport from the Commission will also improve the EU’s image in the eyes of our citizens.</literal>

  Mr President, Northern Ireland is passionate about sport. I say this in particular because, in the last 18 months, three proud Ulster men have brought home three world golfing majors to a very small part of the United Kingdom. Somehow or other I do not quite think that the flag of the EU would have warmed the heart or brought a tear to the eye in quite the same way as that Ulster flag did on those very special occasions.

However, I want to turn your attention to recital AH of this report tonight, which states that international competitions continue to constitute a reference model and action should be taken against naturalisations of convenience. In this context, I believe it is right to highlight the continuing problem faced by the Irish Football Association, the governing body of football in Northern Ireland, which in recent years has seen several players declare allegiance to the Republic of Ireland despite being born in the United Kingdom and having represented Northern Ireland throughout junior levels.</literal>

I would like to quote from one of his speeches: ‘Sport develops the sort of values that European society needs, and it is a very powerful component in the formation of a democratic society. It has numerous positive elements, but there are also many negative aspects. Money is often a more decisive factor in sport than sporting performance. Problems such as violence in sports grounds, racism and drug-taking are cancers that destroy sport. Rules must be established to address these problems’.

  –… for the excellent, comprehensive report drafted by the rapporteur, which is welcome in light of the debates on the particular role of sport.

Sport, which is one of the most multifaceted activities, has implications for various areas, ranging from health, tourism and the economy to education, social integration and the promotion of peace. I should stress that attention must be paid to both professional and amateur sport. It is well known that investing in sporting activities reduces public expenditure on health significantly. I therefore support not only the elderly but children too getting involved in sport. Providing schools with the equipment they need for PE lessons is vital for encouraging children to fulfil the minimum number of three hours of sport recommended by the European Parliament. These are just some of the arguments in favour of having a budget specifically for sport in the forthcoming Multiannual Financial Framework, so that we comply with a provision granted to the EU by the Treaty of Lisbon.

We should remember that sport in Europe represents, whether directly or indirectly, 15 million jobs – that is, 5.4% of the active population – and an annual added value of EUR 407 billion, which is 3.65% of European GDP. For this reason, because sport is so important, I welcome the Commission’s initiative and support, and I would also venture to ask the Commissioner whether Structural Funds could be applied specifically to sport.

Above all, I would like to thank the main political groups in this House for their support. Thanks to the support shown by those groups, I hope that this report will be adopted in tomorrow’s vote.</literal>

               –I welcome the report of Mr Fisas Ayxela and would like to thank him for his work. Mr Fisas Ayxela ’s report supports the achievements made by the Commission and the Council in the field of sport. I therefore particularly approve of the fact that the ‘Erasmus for All’ programme, in line with the priorities pronounced by the European Parliament in connection with sport, involve sport as a new area of support.

The actions proposed to support sport under the new programme are in line with the European Union Work Plan for Sport adopted during the Hungarian Presidency. I welcome that the programme treats physical activity for health improvement as an important subject. As regards the need to support mobility in sport, as expressed in the report on the European dimension in sport, a sub-programme targeting the previously unsupported area of sport is introduced as a new element of the ‘Erasmus for All’ programme. With the adoption of the report we can make an especially successful start into the European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations, as sport has an acknowledged role in health preservation and has special importance in respect of active ageing.</literal>

               The participation of the most disadvantaged communities in sport activities and their access to related facilities is way below the average. Their higher involvement in competitive or mass sport would not only improve their physical and mental health but would also serve as an effective tool for social inclusion and education. Moreover, extending the sport sector could also function as an employment creation factor, particularly in disadvantaged regions. The full access to sport should therefore not only be viewed as a matter of leisure, but as a social service of general social and economic interest. Member States must take appropriate measures to increase the number of socially disadvantaged children in competitive and leisure sport activities and to improve skills and develop a positive attitude to an active life for disadvantaged youth, and the Structural Funds could be mobilised in order to develop sport facilities and opportunities so that disadvantaged children can engage in sport outside school in disadvantaged regions. Special incentives – such as scholarships – might also be developed to help disadvantaged children enter the talent care programmes of all main branch associations.</literal>

I call on the Commission to do everything possible within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon to develop and support sport for people with disabilities. I would like to take the opportunity to point out that the Deaflympics, the Olympic movement of the deaf, has been suffering from a lack of funding by the EU and its Member States for years; in 2010 Slovakia cancelled the Winter Deaflympics, while Greece withdrew from hosting it in 2013.

Now there are efforts in Hungary to make the organisation of a limited Deaflympics possible. With this neglect we are severely endangering the futures of thousands of professional deaf sportspeople. This is unacceptable and something must be done about it.</literal>

               –As President of the Polish Rugby Union and as Vice Chair of the European Parliament Rugby Union Intergroup, I would like to refer to the section on the social role of sport. I appreciate the fact that the rapporteur urges the Commission to propose the way in which funding for European Union sports policy could be included in the new Multiannual Financial Framework. Furthermore, I think it would be a good idea to make it possible to use the European Social Fund to pay for the employment of instructors and trainers to run extra sports lessons in schools and facilities for young people.

The social role of sport deserves to be highlighted. Sport is of huge importance for personal development, particularly that of children and young people, and is also an effective tool for social integration. It also plays a significant role in the fight against all forms of discrimination and social exclusion. This is why it is so important, in my opinion, to promote sport and support every kind of sporting initiative.</literal>

               . –Sport can play a significant role in achieving the objectives set in the European Commission’s Europe 2020 strategy promoting rapid, sustainable and consistent development.

Recent estimates indicate that 15 million people are employed directly or indirectly in the sporting sector in the EU. According to the same estimates, this sector amounts to 3.65% of EU GDP. Major sporting events such as the Olympic Games or the European Football Championships attract millions of spectators and have a considerable impact economically and in terms of jobs. However, the potential offered by sport as an industry has not been fully tapped yet, even though Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union now contains the legal bases for including sport as part of existing European programmes.

I call on the European Commission to include sport as part of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) programmes. This step would significantly improve the conditions for funding sports-related projects.</literal>

               I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur and the entire Committee for a very productive debate and also for a very comprehensive report on a topic that is being addressed separately for the first time in the European Parliament. I also welcome the fact that the European Commission has made room for sport in the new Erasmus for All programme for education and young people in the new 2014-2020 budget period.

I am pleased that we have been able, along with our colleagues, to influence the future of European sport as a force for social integration and reinforcement of a European identity, and to promote important elements such as mandatory physical education in schools and equal opportunities in sport for women and girls and the physically disabled, ensuring that they have access to appropriate sporting facilities. It is also important to create effective rules, ensuring that young sportsmen and sportswomen study properly at school and have proper professional development alongside their sporting activities. It is important to see sport as an instrument for combating intolerance, racism and violence, and also to increase protection for underage young people in professional sport.

I therefore hope that the Commission will submit an ambitious budget for sports policy, taking account of the public health aspects, and the social, cultural and economic benefits, and that these proposals will be implemented in practice as soon as possible.</literal>

               –As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on women in sport, I consider it particularly important for women to hold management positions, for women to participate in sport and for attention to be paid to the two issues of education and sport. It is imperative to guarantee equal access for women and men to sport – affordable, age-appropriate sport – in particular for girls and women from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds. We need to ensure and promote access to disciplines which are adapted to the needs and aspirations of women. It is also important to ensure parity in membership of sporting decision-making bodies and in access to the positions of trainer and administrator in sporting associations. Despite the rise in the participation of women in sport which has taken place in recent years, their participation in decision-making and managerial roles has not increased. As long as there is a lack of women in management and decision-making positions, and by the same token a lack of female role models in sport, the objective of equal opportunities for women and girls will be impossible to achieve. As part of education and sport I propose running awareness campaigns targeted at nurseries and schools, to awaken an interest in sport among children and young people. It is important to increase, diversify and extend the programme of physical education by including lessons on issues related to training for women, such as differences in tempo and expected levels of achievement.</literal>

               –I welcome today’s vote on the report on the European dimension in sport. The fact that with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon sport became a competence of the European Union is a turning point in the development of sport on a European scale. It is unquestionably paramount that the European Commission propose a dedicated budget for the funding of sports policy under the future Multiannual Financial Framework. It is also important to establish a training and qualifications framework for coaches and their education, to encourage women to be more involved in professional sport and to condemn violation of the principle of fair play. Rivalry between professionals is often full of negative emotions which definitely go beyond the bounds of competition. In the context of the whole of society such a situation is not acceptable in view of the power of the behaviour of sportspeople to influence others, particularly young people. It is important to note the urgent need to rebuild the values which we find in the concept of fair play in sport. It is also important to combat doping with the help of preventative campaigns and information campaigns, and to treat trade in these substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs. Coordinated action aimed at achieving a uniform approach to setting and enforcing sanctions against supporters who have displayed violent or discriminatory behaviour will help improve the level of safety at stadiums during sporting events. Finally, I would also like to express my support for the establishment of a non-public European register of sports agents.</literal>

               Mr President, the EU is based on common values, rights and duties, and on respect for these. It was created with this idea in mind, and can continue to function only with this idea. Hungary is from this perspective an important partner for us, often proving its indisputable place in the European family. It is therefore important to have no doubt about this, even today.

We are currently holding talks with Hungary on technical details relating to the independence of the national bank and the judiciary, as well as the attitude to values that are clearly defined in the EU treaties. These include, first and foremost, respect for the principles of democracy, human rights and freedom. No strong popular government can afford to underestimate these values. I firmly believe that it is our common interest to continue having a strong and reliable partner in Hungary, respecting the values that unite us. I believe that Hungary shares a similar interest.</literal>

Both these treaties have a far-reaching impact on people’s lives. They involve very tough rules and measures which will be taken in the future and will affect European citizens’ private lives, as well as their workplace and standard of living. There are countries in the European Union where these treaties have not been subject to any kind of public debate at all. There are state presidents who have not discussed either treaty even once in their national parliaments. For example, no one in Romania knows what ACTA stands for or what the Stability Treaty means. This is not democracy, and if we want to exit the crisis and have a united, powerful Europe, we must defend democratic values.</literal>

  –Mr President, between the 1960s and 1980s, thousands of babies were stolen in Spain. The motive was financial. Many mothers were given the tragic, false news that the son or daughter they had just given birth to had died. A death certificate was issued and a pretend burial was held, but in fact those babies were kidnapped and sold.

In the Basque Country alone there may be as many as 600 cases, leading to 200 legal investigations. So far three graves have been opened – they were all empty. These crimes could only have been committed by means of an official, organised plot.

Until just a few months ago, there was silence on this issue. All formal complaints were shelved. The group[‘SOS Stolen Babies’] is raising awareness of this problem. It is made up of victims who are looking for their sons and daughters, and demanding justice and compensation.

Those who are responsible for what took place committed a criminal offence and created thousands of personal tragedies that cannot be undone, because they affect parents, children and adoptive families.

That is why I would ask you to show involvement, support and sensitivity. If the European institutions keep a close watch over this obscure subject, it will help to fully bring the matter to light.</literal>

  –Mr President, the Eurostat unemployment figures that have just been published are an indictment of the EU and its policies. In Portugal, overall unemployment has already hit 14%. It is 31% among young people, something that has not been seen in 38 years of democracy.

These figures show the tragic consequences of the aggressive programme carried out by the IMF and the EU: more recession, more unemployment, the steep rise in the cost of living, attacks on public services such as healthcare and transport, the takeover of strategic sectors of the country’s economy, more inequality and more poverty.

These figures and facts give the lie to the empty rhetoric of growth and employment that came out of the last meeting of the Council. At the same time, foreign debt, which is used to justify this sordid programme, will grow in 2012, subjecting the country to stock jobbing and the predation of its resources by way of interest on the debt. This path can only lead to disaster. Disaster can be avoided by a change in policy. That is increasingly what they are calling for in Portugal and throughout Europe.</literal>

  –Mr President, on 18 November, I tabled a question to the European Commission on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. This is a subject which is extremely important and which has been the cause of a great deal of emotion and controversy in public debate in many of the European Union’s Member States, including in my country of Poland. Amongst other things, I asked if ACTA is consistent with fundamental rights, with the fundamental legal measures and standards of the European Union. On 5 January, I received a reply from the Commissioner, Mr De Gucht, on behalf of the Commission, in which he wrote that yes, ACTA is in line with the relevant European Union legislation, and also that it complies with the general – and I quote – principles of EU law and now also with the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, on 24 November 2011 the Court of Justice of the European Union handed down a judgment which ruled to my surprise that the situation is completely different, and that in fact ACTA does in one respect violate fundamental human rights and the rights guaranteed by the European Union. The matter therefore requires urgent explanation.</literal>

Other anti-crisis measures are also going to be continued. In addition, work on the Union’s Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014-2020 is entering a crucial phase.

This year, too, we mark the 50th anniversary of the operation of the common agricultural policy. It was one of the first policies to have an exceptionally large share in the Union’s budget, but its purpose, based on the Treaties of Rome, was also exceptionally important: to ensure the supply of a sufficient amount of food at reasonable prices, and also to guarantee reasonable incomes for farmers. During and after the war, Europe was affected by hunger, so the problem of nutrition became an exceptionally important objective of the Union’s work. The 50 years of experience with the common agricultural policy have been exceptionally fruitful. This year they are sure to be the subject of a number of conferences and a major information campaign, and the lessons which have been drawn from those years will help produce a correct prediction of how the common agricultural policy will operate in the years 2014-2020.</literal>

  –Mr President, the management of the multinational company Teka has announced that it will take action to terminate the employment of 198 workers at its factory in Cajo, Santander (Cantabria), a region that is already greatly affected by the growing unemployment of recent months.

This measure will also affect 400 related jobs with subsidiary companies that are also located in the region.

Teka does not have sufficient economic reasons to have taken this decision. Behind the move is the plain and simple fact that the company is relocating outside the European Union.

I would therefore call on the European Commission to demand that the Government of Cantabria and the Government of Spain make a greater commitment to the workers in our region by seeking an end solution to this social conflict and therefore examining all the options at European level, such as making the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund available to it.

Europe cannot afford any more unemployed workers, and I would particularly like to ask the President of the Government of Cantabria, who, in his election manifesto, promised to take care of the companies that were already established in his Autonomous Community, to do just that and turn his words into actions.

  Mr President, in Ireland we are told to keep the rules of the new fiscal treaty, as it will eliminate any risk of future crisis and will help solve the current one. From 2002 to 2008 Ireland did not once break the Stability and Growth Pact – unlike others. So we know from bitter experience that keeping to the rules does not always deliver and certainly will not deal with the current crisis. In 2007 we had a debt-to-GNP ratio of 30%. By 2014 it will have ballooned to 145%. No developed economy can survive those levels of debt.

We have just survived four years of austerity. Our debt levels, directly linked to bailing out banks in Ireland and in Europe, are unsustainable, and yet we are told that more of the same, without any commitment to Eurobonds, to redemption funds or debt restructuring, will solve our problems. It will not and it cannot, and given that our access to the ESM is tied to ratification of the Treaty, this is little short of blackmail. Those are the hardest words I have ever said in this Parliament. I hope I never have to repeat them. Europe can do much better than that for itself and for Ireland.</literal>

I am not asking Mr Draghi to allow the European Central Bank to sustain losses.

In Spain, both the central government and some autonomous communities are making drastic cuts in public spending on health and education, and this is causing an extremely serious deterioration in the public health and education systems, triggering the privatisation of those services. This is unacceptable.

As an example of this, in a small local district – although not that small – called Hospitalet de Llobregat, in Catalonia, attempts are being made to close the primary healthcare centre, which has led the citizens of the town to take action; they have locked themselves inside for the past 97 days in order to prevent the closure of the Bellevitge health centre.

  –Mr President, I was deeply shocked when I saw a drawing in the morning press, a racist, xenophobic cartoon actually produced and published by a French politician who is a member of the National Front and a candidate in the parliamentary elections. It insults the Romanian people in an unacceptable and indecent way by using a statement which I find difficult to repeat. This politician says: ‘Watch out for the Father Christmas from Romania who comes into your house by the door and leaves with the TV.’ Mr Poncet is making an unacceptable generalisation, insulting a hard-working, well-educated people who have always been supportive of France and of the values which France represents. The leadership of the French National Front criticised this political message, and I also expect our three colleagues belonging to the National Front to do likewise.</literal>

  –Mr President, the political situation in Romania is going through a period of crisis where the democratic foundations of the rule of law are under attack. The situation has deteriorated in the last three years to the point where citizens have taken to the streets, as has already been mentioned in this House, in a series of protests which have been unprecedented in the last two decades. The current administration has governed badly, violated civil liberties, caused much social suffering, sidelined fundamental institutions, such as parliament, attempted to abolish political pluralism and invented parliamentary parties to support the government, but which have never received any endorsement at the ballot box. In these circumstances, the opposition has decided today to adopt a more radical form of political action by refusing to participate in parliamentary proceedings, thereby trying to ensure respect for dignity and constitutional rights. We also call for a return to a democratic and civilised form of behaviour, in keeping with European political values.</literal>

  Mr President, the European Parliament came under cyber attack by Anonymous last week after the EU had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan. Meanwhile I have received a vast number of messages from EU citizens and beyond, who were concerned about their rights.

I find it bizarre that the EU and 22 of its Member States signed ACTA before addressing the concerns of the citizens in an appropriate transparent manner, as democracies should. Therefore, I call on the Commission and the Member States to increase efforts to communicate ACTA to citizens and to seek their consent when it is ratified. The EU and the national governments have to reassure citizens that ACTA will not violate the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and privacy.</literal>

Those expressing such criticism are often unfamiliar with the conditions, laws and everyday life in Hungary.

As a representative of the Hungarian minority of Romania I have been closely following the internal politics of not only Hungary, but also Romania, Slovakia and even Serbia.

Ladies and gentlemen, if you are concerned about human and minority rights, I would like to bring to your attention the state law that is still in force in Slovakia and the fact that people are being stripped of their citizenship even though this is prohibited under the effective Slovak constitution.

I would also like to draw your attention to the Slovak language law, and also to Romania, where the provisions of the education law in force are being grossly disregarded when it comes to the establishment of minority university faculties. When you express your concerns about the application of the rule of law, please do so in a credible manner and avoid even the appearance of your being interested only in the activities of the government of a single country.</literal>

A Moldovan citizen, Vadim Pisari, just 18 years of age, was killed at the Vadul lui Vodă checkpoint by a Russian soldier from the peacekeeping troops. This event has stunned the whole community and stirred a feeling of insecurity among them. This tragedy reminds us that there is still an unresolved conflict on the European Union’s doorstep, and failure to resolve it is delaying the Republic of Moldova’s move towards the European Union. The Romanian-speaking population in Transnistria is being subjected to discrimination and having their human rights blatantly violated. The settlement of the Transnistria conflict requires the peacekeeping mission to be turned into a civilian one, with an international mandate.

The popular movements protesting in many Romanian cities over the last three weeks are making one key demand: we want to have confidence in politicians; we want to have confidence in democracy.

The same is also happening in other cities in the country. These people are putting their health at risk because they have had enough of being humiliated and misled by those who govern them. They are all in despair, not only because their right to have a decent life in their country, Romania, is banned, but also because the political authorities are showing them contempt, ignoring and disregarding them. Their despair is only surpassed by the persistence they are showing in continuing their protest. More than 90% of Romanians want the president and the government to go.

Baroness de Vos was Dutch, and for many decades she was the Honorary President of the International Movement ATD Fourth World. She initiated the founding of the Institute for Social Research, which supported the fight against extreme poverty in the emerging European community.

Baroness de Vos went on to forge lasting relationships with the UN. It is thanks to her initiative that we have a special UN rapporteur for extreme poverty and human rights. After the first elections to the European Parliament, she encouraged the creation of the ATD Fourth World committee, at a time when intergroups did not yet exist.

I hope that her political views and activities in the ATD Fourth World family will move our consciences, making us aware at all levels of decision-making that extreme poverty is a violation of human rights, both in the EU and across the world. That is a challenge for all of us.</literal>

Although this event was organised by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) was also present in the hall, being represented by several Romanian MEPs belonging to the party currently in power in Romania. The latter’s only involvement was restricted to their convoluted efforts to hamper the smooth running of proceedings and lower the level of debate, by using tactics that are very familiar to Romanians, in an attempt to distract attention towards trivial matters and topics completely unrelated to the content of the debates.

However, once again, the European Parliament proved to be a forum where such behaviour is not tolerated, with the audience immediately taking action against such troublemakers by openly showing their disapproval.

I wish to take this opportunity to thank fellow foreign MEPs and Romanian MEPs from my country and the diaspora who attended this event yesterday, and I assure them that Romanians will continue to fight in good faith to bring back a Romania governed democratically, fairly and honestly.</literal>

Also at that time we had the tragedy with the cruise liner off Italy. It was reported widely in the media that what I might call showboating may have been responsible for this. I want to look at the wider picture. Can we establish whether there are practices like this, which are contrary to safety regulations, being undertaken by cruise ships – and maybe others?

The fight against counterfeit goods would seem to be a good thing. I do not hide the fact that I myself was one of the first victims of Internet piracy, when a film documentary I had made, the Polish documentary entitled, was put on the Internet and was illegally copied thousands of times as long ago as the second half of the 1990s.

I am, however, opposed to ACTA, because by its unclear provisions and its unequal treatment of the parties involved it entails a huge risk of giving rise to oppression in the Internet. This is why thousands of Poland’s young people took to the streets in 80 cities in Poland to protest against ACTA. You see, there was an incident in my country in which eight officers of Poland’s special Internal Security Agency entered the home of an Internet user in order to take control of a small website which had been criticising the public authorities. If the Internal Security Agency, which uses its officers to suppress freedom in the Internet, is given something like ACTA, there is no doubt at all that it will make use of these new powers. So it is imperative to defend freedom in the Internet. We should abandon ACTA. Long live the free Internet!</literal>

  ,–Mr President, allow me to begin by expressing my thanks to the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, particularly Ms Leffler and others who collaborated with me to make this report possible, including Ms Martín, Mr Kox and Ms Remacle.

Mr President, it is almost over a year since the Committee on Petitions decided to draw up a report on waste management in the EU. The decision was taken after it was established that large numbers of repeat petitions were being put forward, condemning the poor waste management carried out by the authorities, the location of certain rubbish dumps, the destruction of some natural areas, and so on.

The Committee on Petitions was sensitive to these claims, and sent several fact-finding missions to the areas concerned in order to verifythe truth of the complaints made by the petitioners. All of this has led us here today, to the plenary session of the European Parliament, in order to make it clear that the proper application of current legislation by Member States is an unresolved issue that requires particular attention and on which we should remain vigilant.

As I said at the beginning of my speech, most European citizens expect public authorities to provide efficient and effective public services in terms of health, education, transport and security. However, the issue that provokes a growing number of petitions is the apparent inability of public authorities in many countries to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management.

The European Union has adopted a broad raft of legislation, applicable in all Member States, in order to ensure that the legal framework exists to deal with the inevitable result of our modern lifestyle in terms of all the things we discard as waste from our household, from our place of work, from our hospitals, from our industries and so on. It is obvious to all that failure to manage such issues, and failure to prioritise efforts in this respect, produces not only negative effects on human health and well-being, but also on the viability of the planet and its environment.

Judging by the petitions received, the concern of many local communities is growing, and this indicates that waste management is becoming a major political and social problem and people expect the European Union to deal with it somehow. An analysis of the waste management policies implemented in the Member States provides very contrasting information and serious breaches of EU legislation.

The Commission reported in January 2011 that 177 infringement cases concerning landfills had been launched since the deadline for implementing the Landfill Directive in 2001. They had furthermore calculated that there were at the very least 619 illegal landfills still being used in the EU. In its strategic report on the prevention and recycling of waste, the Commission clearly demonstrates that it is using its best efforts to address the issue of waste management, and it also outlines its medium-term proposals.

It should be recalled in this context, Mr President, that the large number of infringement cases mentioned aim at ensuring legal compliance, yet from the petitioners’ perspective, more effort needs to be made to ensure proper follow-up actions in the actual implementation of the law.

Closely linked to the waste management process, although upstream of the process, are the EU directives dealing with environmental impact assessments and the access of citizens to information concerning the environment.</literal>

               –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo’s report deals with the problem of shortcomings in waste disposal in some Member States, which is of concern to the people of Europe. I would like to express my considerable thanks to Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, who has made a very good job of putting this report back on an objective footing.

In some regions of Europe, there remain serious problems with waste management. In particular, there is a lack of realisable plans for the avoidance, reuse and processing of waste. This gives rise to mountains of waste that overflow into other countries.

The Committee on Petitions has been able to get a very accurate picture of the situation in the regions through its many visits to the locations concerned. In view of the potential environmental damage and harm to public health that could be caused by waste, we need to get to grips with this problem quickly and consistently. The important thing is for all the regions to implement the existing EU legislation in this area promptly and to draw up comprehensive waste management plans. These regulations do, after all, exist; and therefore they must be complied with by the various countries. The responsibility for this lies primarily with the Member States.

I also am looking to the Commission here. It should intervene at an early stage if it becomes clear that plans are not being properly produced in the regions or regulations are not being correctly implemented, or if the regions are unable or unwilling to draw up and implement such plans. As part of this, sanctions must be imposed quickly and consistently if regions do not comply. Naturally, consumers also have a crucial role to play. Without an awareness among the public of waste avoidance and separation, it will be difficult to establish a positive and functioning recycling system – in other words, a genuinely circular flow of materials.

After all, of all the current waste recycling options, the best waste is that which never arises in the first place and can be avoided at the outset. That is good for people, good for the environment and saves resources that can usefully be used elsewhere.

Allow me to sum up what I have said. Firstly, we need the regions to draw up a plan for waste recycling and avoidance. I emphatically agree with the Commission when it says that there can be no money from Brussels unless a clear plan is in place. That is only right. Secondly, and this issue is just as important, we must hold the Member States to account if those responsible in the regions are unable or unwilling to establish such a plan. The Member States must help them to develop such a plan. If there is still a delay – and this is my only criticism of the Commission – then the Commission must help the Member States to produce such a plan quickly, so that our beautiful continent is not spoilt by mountains of waste.</literal>

               –Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her positive words and for agreeing with us that it is absolutely essential to give consideration to an effective waste policy.

Over the last few years, we have come across many citizens from various Member States in the Committee on Petitions. Some countries, such as Italy, Bulgaria and Romania, still send a great deal of waste to landfill, although, if I am honest, the petitions did not come from those countries alone. It would seem that waste really is a problem that needs to be taken seriously, a problem that has an impact on a large number of citizens. We can see that there is a lack of transparency. Citizens want to know what is happening, how the authorities are dealing with something that is currently seen as a problem but is actually an opportunity. Waste must become an opportunity, rather than a problem, because an opportunity is what it actually is.

You told us that everything is under control and that more attention is going to be paid to this area. Quite honestly, though, we have already asked the Commission on various occasions in Plenary – this is therefore not the first time that we have asked – not just to tell us what needs to happen, but to actually do something.

We have rules, and they are good in the European Union. We make it very clear that there needs to be a plan, that there is a hierarchy and how waste must be handled. Obviously, it is also important for all the planning to be implemented, however – in other words, for there to actually be some action. That is why we are calling for real action, and my colleagues endorse this, for the introduction of a zero tolerance policy, and for subsidy streams to be turned off so that pressure is also brought to bear to take action. Ultimately, we are calling for a Member State to be called to account before the Court of Justice as soon as possible for why nothing has happened, for fines to be imposed whenever applicable.

I am thus asking very clearly for three things. These are also in the report, but I will just recap here in any case.

Firstly, I am calling for a zero tolerance policy.

My second request is for set-up assistance wherever a Member State cannot manage alone. In times of crisis, it is clearly difficult to constantly have to find the people, the resources and the ideas to ultimately handle waste well.

The third thing we need – and this is the most important of all – is real transparency, as that is what the citizens are demanding. Without it, the citizens feel excluded. We need transparency about how waste is handled; in other words, is it toxic, what happens to it, where does it go and is it dealt with lawfully? What do we need to do to ensure that this problem becomes an opportunity, since we need these materials? For goodness’ sake, let us take precisely those regions of Europe that are still having difficulties at this point in time and make them the most modern regions and deal with waste in an entirely new and creative way since, in future, we really will need every bit of plastic.</literal>

               –Mr President, I would like to offer you my best wishes on your new position.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy that today, we are debating in plenary a resolution that stems from the many petitions that reach the European Parliament, and that refers specifically to the question of waste. These petitions demonstrate the concern of European citizens about the harm done to the environment, human health and the economy by waste management practices prevalent in various areas in Europe.

Even though I agree with the overall structure of the resolution, I am rather dissatisfied with how some of its passages address the issue of incinerators. At times, it seems that thanks to technology, any problem related to public health and the environment has been completely overcome. Until last year, right here, we were hearing the same words about nuclear power plants. Today, however, in this same Chamber, it is difficult to find anyone willing to defend the nuclear industry. Is it possible that politics is simply unable to take a long-term view? Do we really have to wait for more epidemiological studies confirming the increased cancer rates already found throughout populations living near incinerators?

This is not the NIMBY syndrome, but simply the citizens defending their right to health. There are alternatives that are virtuous and create employment. We must implement the spirit of the Waste Management Directive strictly, with a waste cycle based on the concepts of reduction, reuse and recycling. Landfill and incineration are residual, hierarchically inferior options, resorted to only after everything else possible has been done. If there was a political will to that effect, incinerators would be a nice memory.

I think that Parliament should take a more advanced stance and better protect its citizens in this area. I hope that the European Commission will propose stricter criteria and procedures for building incinerators and opening landfill sites, and encourage serious ‘zero waste’ policies in all Member States.</literal>

               –Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that this report is suffering from a very serious shortcoming that it has had since its inception. Far too many members of our committee are uneasy, not to say unwilling, when it comes to criticising members of their own party in their own Member States and have therefore succeeded in ensuring that it is not as specific as it should have been in view of the many complaints. It has become far too general a report, which would probably not have been out of place in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. This is something that we ought to change quickly. Our committee cannot operate if we do not all rise above party politics.

Having got that out of the way, I would like to express my wholehearted praise for Mr Iturgaiz Angulo for his almost perfect cooperation on this report. We listened to one another. I believe that, despite the one-sided conditions, this report is a very good one, and I would like to express my thanks for that.

However, I have the same two points of criticism to make that have already been mentioned. Firstly, we have the deficient implementation – the fact that the problems are not taken seriously, there is a lack of adequate cooperation with the Commission and with other regions, town and cities that have solutions in place and citizens are not sufficiently involved. We cannot solve these problems unless we work much more closely with our citizens. In far too many places – in Italy in particular – we have seen that citizens are almost regarded as the enemy when it comes to solving these problems. This has been a horrible experience. We saw something similar but to a slightly less worrying extent in both Bulgaria and Spain, but Italy really is a dismal example in this regard.

My second point of criticism concerns the question of resources. We are currently facing not just one, but two crises. We are currently in the midst of a resource crisis, and clearly the most stupid thing we can do in relation to our scarce resources is to discharge them into the water or place them in a remote landfill site. The second most stupid thing we can do, however, is to burn them. We now have to put a stop to the pyromania. Not even the best incineration plants should be permitted to incinerate our scant resources. We must work at meeting all the requirements of the Waste Management Directive, but also invest intelligently in plants that are able to recover resources so as to develop our waste strategy in a modern way. That is what we need, first and foremost.</literal>

I am involved in Parliament with waste management via my membership of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I have to say how interesting and refreshing it was to read this report from a slightly different perspective, because it does take out a lot of what I might call the vested interests (and I mean that in the nicest possible way) – people who have their views and have had them for a long time and have worked very hard to get what they want through. Sometimes, it is difficult to lift your head up and look at the big picture, so a report such as this, I think, is really very useful.

Of course it is about a subject which very clearly and very closely concerns all of the people that we represent. There are very few subjects for me as a constituency MEP that I get quite so much passion from my voters about as waste management. I feel that it is an area in which we, the European Parliament, stand to be judged. If we do not get it right and if we do not make sure that we enforce, then all of the talking that we do here comes to nothing. All of that is encompassed in this very interesting and useful report.

There are huge differences in the way that Member States deal with the problem of rubbish, and I actually welcome the fact that we have those differences. I welcome the fact that this report recognises very strongly the issue of subsidiarity. It is about a Waste Framework Directive. Many of you will remember my predecessor, the lady that I replaced in this Parliament – Caroline Jackson – who was the rapporteur on the Waste Framework Directive. One of the principles that she was very keen on espousing was that Member States should be allowed as much subsidiarity as possible within the framework of tight and challenging targets. I know from recent conversations with her that she is extremely disappointed that, having been given that freedom, Member States are not delivering, because we are not making those targets.

Where we need to really tighten up – and this is in the report – is not on a whole raft of new regulations but on making those that we currently have work better and more effectively. A framework is just that. We need to get our Member States working towards that framework. I was really shocked here to see how many infringements there are in my own Member State – I thought we were doing OK. So in that sense, this is a great report for bringing that home.

Just on one point: I am happy to defend nuclear energy. But it has to be done with good technology, tightly controlled. The same is the case for incineration.</literal>

               –Mr President, both the report by Mr Angulo and the number and content of the petitions received by the Commission from citizens and operators prove two things: firstly, that the problem of waste is an urgent and burning issue and, secondly, that, despite the differences that obviously exist, the Member States are not performing satisfactorily in terms of waste management, thereby creating public health and environmental problems. One point on which I would like to comment, which the report also underlines, is that, although landfill is the last resort under EU legislation, there are countries, mine included, which are lagging behind in recycling and prevention and are therefore under pressure to extend existing landfills or create new ones, in breach of Community legislation and common sense, thereby causing serious problems in local communities and resulting in conflicts and solutions that are dangerous to the environment and public health. The second comment on the report that I wish to address to the Commissioner has to do with various cases in which the Commission washes its hands and is indifferent to the fact that it needs to intervene, such as where there are obvious errors in the waste management plans and environmental impact studies being processed. In such cases, Commissioner, the Commission needs to intervene. I think that the report, generally speaking, concerns a useful directive that will assist us in waste management.</literal>

               –Mr President, firstly, I should like to congratulate Mr Iturgaiz Angulo on his exceptional report, which we discussed in committee and on which we congratulated him at first reading. European citizens expect government authorities to provide adequate and effective services, especially in the waste sector, because they have a massive impact and harmful repercussions on public health and the environment. According to the UN, mankind’s problems up to 2030 will be as follows, in the following order: combating social exclusion, immigration and environmental issues. I do not know if they are in the right order, but this is an issue which deserves serious attention. The petitions received on the subject by the Committee on Petitions are now a regular occurrence. I therefore recommend, as the report emphasises, that the 2008 directive should apply to waste, as it lays down rules to protect the environment and human health, with the aim of preventing or reducing adverse repercussions from the production and management of waste. We need to pay attention to resources, to sites and to the public and, when I say the public, I mean that we need to educate the public. We need transparency in waste management procedures because waste management is a huge economic event. We need to pay particular attention to all this throughout Europe.</literal>

  –Mr President, the EU generates 2 billion tonnes of waste, of which 40 million tonnes is classed as special waste, every year. On abasis, it puts the role of India and China as waste producers into perspective. Although North America, Western Europe, Japan and Korea are known to lead the field when it comes to recycling, they still generate more waste than the rest of the world put together. The developments that go hand-in-hand with rising disposal costs should not be underestimated. In the US, electronics manufacturers save on disposal costs by shipping electronic waste to Africa or other areas of the developing world and calling it development aid, not to mention the innumerable tonnes of German PET bottles that are processed into stuffing for soft toys in China, where expensive environmental legislation and rules on worker protection do not apply, or which eventually end up in items of clothing destined for the West.

In addition, many materials can only undergo the recycling process a limited number of times. In other cases, only a small proportion can be recycled. Downcycling is just as much of a problem as transporting waste all the way across Europe and the black sheep that dump waste illegally. What might be helpful, therefore, is the combination of an increase in recycling rates together with strict controls on exports of electronic waste and a shifting of the cost burden onto those who cause the waste. Waste avoidance measures are even more important, however. In ordering everyone to use toxic energy-saving bulbs, the EU has hardly covered itself in glory in this respect. Moreover, we must not forget that the issue of the storage of nuclear waste has still not been resolved. That is yet another reason to refrain from building more nuclear power stations.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, for the work he has done.

This own-initiative report from the Committee on Petitions stems from the strong need, felt by most, to respond more fully to the citizens who have submitted to the Committee on Petitions countless petitions, which are, in point of fact, complaints, regarding serious misapplication of EU law in the environmental sector, but particularly in the field of waste management.

One hundred and fourteen petitions, over a period of time that we can describe as short, from 16 different countries with the highest numbers from countries such as Spain, Ireland, Italy and Greece. The most common complaint relates to the improper activation of incineration and waste-treatment plants. This indicates that citizens are badly informed with regard to the effectiveness of the advanced technologies used for these types of plants.

I believe that this sector is extremely important, especially at such a sensitive time as this, with a global financial crisis that is also devastating the European Union. As the Commission has often repeated, following numerous detailed studies on the issue, a different use of waste resources would save the EU more than EUR 72 billion and would create more than 40 million jobs. I think these figures are important, in particular, when combined with the benefits for the environment and health, which are really the primary concern for us all.</literal>

I consider that the suggestions made in this report, at certain points at least, may allow the Commission and the Member States to adapt their policies, in order to address a problem which, although not equally serious in all the EU Member States, is taking on ever increasing dimensions. I consider that the Member States have a basic obligation to inform their citizens, without confining themselves merely to comments, and to restore confidence in connection with a problem that concerns us all. I think that it goes without saying that we need more objective data to measure environmental infringements. Finally, I consider cross-border cooperation to be very important.</literal>

  –Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, for an excellent report. In the period 2004-2010, the Committee on Petitions actually received and declared admissible a total of 114 petitions, alleging breaches of European Union legislation on waste alone. This indicates all too clearly that the issue is a topical one, and one that is also rightly worrying the public.

There are enormous differences among the Member States of the European Union as regards their waste management policies, and this is something that we ought to be able to address more closely. The deadline for the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive expired in 2010, and only six Member States have managed to implement it. In other words, public concern regarding the matter needs to be taken very seriously.

It also needs to be remembered that waste is an opportunity. As has been said, waste is a resource, and improvements in waste management are also bound to create new jobs and improve resource efficiency in the European Union.</literal>

  –Mr President, although the report describes the environmental crimes that pass for waste management and environmentally catastrophic practices, it adopts all the factors that cause them. Instead of proposing measures to combat the pollution caused with impunity by big business, the report openly advertises the catastrophic action by monopolies in the sector. It welcomes Directive 2000/98/EC, which promotes the incineration of waste for energy, which is destroying the environment and putting public health in danger, in order to increase capitalist profits. That same directive legalises pollution with impunity by industrial capital, because it allows hazardous waste to be mixed with non-hazardous waste. The report refers to the role of organised crime in creating environmental dangers, in order to conceal the real class-based crime against the environment being committed by the monopolies, the bodies of the European Union and the governments of the Member States. In Greece, in Argolida, Crete and numerous other areas, the health of the workers is at permanent risk from the landfills containing toxic sludge that are operating next door to their homes. The solution, as far as we in the Greek Communist Party are concerned, is to reverse the anti-environmental policy of the European Union, in order to safeguard the health of the workers and protect the environment.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excellent and balanced report which also rightly refers to the principle of subsidiarity, and therefore recognises the important and pre-eminent role played by Member States.

The report, however, also paints a picture of a multi-speed Europe. As far as my country is concerned, there are two speeds. On the one hand, there are certain cities and regions – for example, Naples and Campania – that are a source of shame for those of us who, for the moment, have identity cards issued by the Italian State, a great source of shame that we continue to denounce. On the other hand, there are the virtuous towns of Padania where we have hundreds of mayors, for example, those of the Northern League, who may be ‘barbarian dreamers’, but who are also civilised people who teach citizens and ensure that they sort their rubbish and who organise the collection and incineration of waste. This civilised part of our country is an example for Europe.

So let us move forward in this direction. I welcome the petitions which also inform the European authorities of these situations which, as I have said before, in Campania also pose a threat to European tourists who risk setting foot in those areas.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to mention the rapporteur, Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, for the quality of his work, for the long negotiations that he has had to lead, and for the patience he has displayed.

We have finally arrived at the vote on this report, which is extremely important because it allows us to raise our fellow citizens’ difficulties and fears in this Chamber before the Commission and the Council. Here is further proof of the effectiveness of the right of petition in Europe.

The majority of petitions are related to the environment and waste represents a major concern for our fellow citizens. This issue must reflect a problem in society. We are consuming left, right and centre. We are only now realising that what we do not consume we throw away. This awareness must absolutely be reinforced among the citizens; this much is clear.

Yet this report is also a timely reminder for the Member States. It is nevertheless worrying to see that the States do not seem to be in control of the situation. Only six Member States transposed the framework directive on waste on time. The number of complaints received regarding the issue sometimes shows the lack of transparency in the choice of location for landfill sites.

Finally, and this is the most worrying aspect, members of organised crime seem to do as they please. A EUR 75 billion market is very attractive to the greedy. The Member States must send out a strong signal. There must be greater penalties for companies that use public contracts to enhance their own wealth.

This report is a warning to the Member States, but the European Commission must also play its part and ensure that the directives on waste are properly implemented.

This dossier needs to be made visible but also credible. If no one plays the game, we will continue to waste time and money on verification and counter-verification procedures which could go on for years. Let us listen to the message from the petitioners and put a stop to this mess as soon as possible.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the hundreds of petitions to the European Parliament from various EU countries clarify the extent and severity of the waste management problem.

An interesting aspect of the report is the attention paid to the disposal of illegal waste that affects many regions. In my region, as a delegation from the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was able to ascertain, high levels of caesium-137 have been detected. This is typical nuclear waste even though there are no nuclear power plants in Italy.

It is clear that this is a Europe-wide problem. There is illegal trafficking of waste that must be monitored and curbed, but which has so far been ignored by the European Commission. It is therefore easy to state that only a few countries, including Italy, do not apply European standards. Instead, given that illegal trafficking of waste extends beyond national borders, we need to think about how to deal with this at a European level.</literal>

  –Mr President, this resolution lists 115 cases involving claims from citizens of 14 Member States that the Waste Management Directive has been infringed. However, we all know that there are far more cases of this type, even if they have not all been brought to the attention of the Committee on Petitions. I personally know of at least one case in Romania which is being investigated at regional level. This situation is a serious indication of the failure by many national governments to enforce this vital legislation for protecting the environment and our citizens’ health. However, the situation regarding waste from mining activities is also just as worrying. I have reiterated my concern on this matter, both within Parliament and directly to the European Commission. The Commission assures us that the Mining Waste Directive contains sufficient provisions to protect the environment, including in connection with mining using cyanide technologies. However, I call on the Commission to answer the following question: what will happen if the Mining Waste Directive is enforced to the same degree as the Waste Management Directive? It does not require too much imagination to realise that the consequences of such a situation would be really disastrous.</literal>

For all the many citizens who petition Parliament, I am afraid to say that there are many other citizens who have no regard for waste management. We need to acknowledge that public awareness needs to be increased in relation to how to manage waste, both within the home and at work. There is much to be done. If people were obliged to visit landfills that were not working properly, they might think twice about dumping waste and putting it into refuse sacks. I know that in County Louth, where I come from, there is an old landfill dump that now soaks up a great deal of money because of the environmental problems it poses, and it also causes difficulties for the people who live in the area.

I would ask the Commission to address the issue of recycling tyres – perhaps not today, Commissioner – as this certainly is an area where there is a lot of illegal activity. We are not getting the value from the recycling of tyres that we could.</literal>

In most Member States, major investment is required to introduce waste management strategies and suitable infrastructures and facilities.

I call on the Commission to support Member States in the process of implementing European legislation by providing suitable funding mechanisms and clear, precise guidelines and criteria regarding the location of landfills in relation to residential areas, schools, local health care centres and drinking waters sources, in order to provide stronger guarantees against possible risks to human health and the environment. Public dialogue is vital right from the planning stage. I should emphasise the importance of impact studies and having public debate about them.

Personally, I believe that greater attention should be paid to processing organic waste, particularly in those regions where agriculture plays an active part. Organic waste is comparatively easy to use if it is incinerated, but in this way, we lose a lot of value. Products with new added value could very well be produced from this form of waste and, here, finance could also come from the second pillar planned for agriculture. Stricter standards need to be brought in for both waste management and the use of chemicals in agriculture and industry.</literal>

  –Mr President, waste management is seen by the public as a very sensitive issue. The European Commission should therefore monitor compliance with the waste management directives in the individual countries. The conclusions of the Commission report from the beginning of the previous year showed that several EU countries are not paying proper attention to the protection of the environment and waste management. Dozens of proceedings for breaches of legal regulations and information on hundreds of illegal and thousands of non-compliant landfills are alarming findings and draw our attention to the fact that the Commission is also failing in this area in the enforcement of EU legislation.

Waste treatment, if it is well organised, can be a profitable sector of the economy, and waste recycling is a great help to us in environmental conservation. Therefore, as has been shown, we will need to make much greater efforts to implement better functioning mechanisms for the management and effective treatment of waste.</literal>

  –Mr President, illegal or non-compliant landfills and incinerators are indeed a disturbing problem. They are a threat to both health and environmental safety. They also mean the absence of the savings which can be realised by smart and effective waste management, and the absence of the potential to recover valuable raw materials which are in short supply. They also mean lost jobs.

Much remains to be done in the field of raising the citizens’ awareness about responsible waste management and its resultant benefits. It is important to have greater coordination of waste management at regional and local level, as well as for residents to have easy access to transparent information, not just about how waste should be sorted, but also about what happens to it later.

In many countries, modernising the waste management system is going to require significant investment. Funding this work should also be one of the Union’s priorities. Furthermore, it would be particularly useful to intensify action to identify best practices and facilitate their exchange at national level and throughout Europe.</literal>

               –Mr President, I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Georgieva for her interesting opinions and also my fellow Members who have participated in this debate. To some of the latter, I would like to say that comments have been made about the appropriateness or otherwise of holding this debate in the Committee on Petitions, and of referring the matter on from that Committee to this House.

With your permission, Mr President, I would like to commend and defend the Committee on Petitions as an appropriate setting in which to debate these issues. I say this given that those who submitted petitions, the citizens of the European Union, have addressed the Committee on Petitions. Apart from the fact that citizens can address other committees, such as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and bearing in mind that opinions may be developed and reports drawn up in other committees, I think that when citizens approach the Committee on Petitions, they want us to respond and provide a solution to their problems. Clearly, we cannot look the other way or divert attention. Were we to do so, there would be no point to the work and actions of the Committee on Petitions within the European Parliament or, indeed, to the very existence of that Committee.

In addition, I would like to say to certain colleagues that the petitions have referred systematically to the constant deficiencies that occur with waste management and to the real, habitual inability of the Member States to fulfil their legal obligations. This really is the way things are at present. These thoughts and problems have also been included in the report, however, hence the request for the Member States to transpose the Waste Management Directive without further delay, and to guarantee that all its provisions are fully complied with, especially through the establishment and application of comprehensive waste management plans.

Therefore, Mr President, I believe that through this report and Ms Georgieva’s own words, a very direct course has been set to try to resolve all the problems that have been outlined by the groups, many problems that are related to this issue, but I also believe that it needs to be emphasised that delaying is not an option, nor can a blind eye be turned, when it comes to resolving the many, many issues and petitions that are being received from countries throughout the European Union.</literal>

               –Bearing in mind that waste and pollution pose serious threats to human health and the integrity of the environment with direct consequences, I think that all Member States have a duty to speed up the introduction of appropriate, advanced waste management strategies, in accordance with the applicable directive.

We are all aware that in most Member States, major investment is required to introduce waste management strategies and suitable infrastructures and facilities. This is why I believe that public authorities should also consider the possibility of earmarking an appropriate proportion of Cohesion Fund resources for this purpose or of applying directly for funding from the European Investment Bank.</literal>

               –The concern of many local communities in relation to waste management is growing. The growing number of petitions bears witness to this. Waste management is becoming a major political and social problem. Failure to manage such issues, and failure to prioritise efforts in this respect, produces not only negative effects on human health and well-being, but also on the viability of the planet and its environment.

Many EU countries are far behind in their implementation of waste strategies and, in this context, the legacy of the past, and an excessive dependence on landfill options, linked to the need to change attitudes towards waste disposal, has caused serious breaches of EU legislation to occur.

All measures must be taken in order to prevent the generation of waste and to ensure preparation for re-use, recycling, other recovery, including energy recovery, and disposal by means of safe incineration, with landfill as the very last resort.</literal>

               –The waste industry in the European Union is a public responsibility, frequently managed by private interests and multinational companies, which handles 60% of household waste and 75% of waste from businesses, with an annual turnover of EUR 75 billion.

An analysis of the waste management policies implemented by EU Member States provides very contrasting information. Some Member States, including Romania, are lagging behind in their implementation of waste management strategies and, in this context, the legacy of the past and the excessive dependence on landfills, along with the attitude towards waste disposal, which should be changed, have caused numerous serious breaches of EU legislation to occur. Article 4 of the new Waste Framework Directive specifies a mandatory waste hierarchy: prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling or other forms of reuse, including energy recovery and disposal by means of safe incineration, with landfills as the very last resort.

I call on Member States which are faced with obvious waste crises to consider the fact that more efficient waste management strategies provide opportunities for job creation and revenue growth, while ensuring environmental sustainability through reuse, recycling and the recovery of energy from waste.</literal>

               –We have just heard from the Commissioner how many benefits recycling, and recycling of electrical waste in particular, bring to the economy. The correct policy for dealing with waste is therefore essential, since electrical waste is one of the fastest growing areas of waste in the European Union.

The Slovak Republic has long since achieved the objective set out in Directive 2002/96/EC and, since 2010, we have been encountering the problem of an excess over the minimum limit of recycling four kilograms of electrical waste per capita per year, and this is going to rise. During the transition period that Slovakia is in, we will therefore cover the deficiencies that remain among producers and importers or from anonymous electronic sales and, likewise, we will restrict the selection of those who still do not contribute to the funding of waste collection and subsequent treatment.

Therefore, I see no reason to grant exemptions elsewhere in the EU so that the exceptions can be abused to obtain certain benefits that would ultimately slow down the development of the recycling industry.</literal>

               –The European Union has recognised the urgent need for responsible waste management and has created a whole system of secondary legislation, placing on the Member States a series of responsibilities related to the storage, segregation and recycling of waste. The Union is moving towards a situation in which waste will stop being a danger to the environment but will instead become an effectively used resource. I think the effort being made in this direction is clearly worthy of praise and support. However, it should be admitted that even the most sincere desire and the most determined action of the EU cannot produce results if the Member States do not express a desire for effective cooperation in this area. Despite the deadline of December 2010 set for transposition of the directive into national law, only six Member States have managed to do this. We in the European Parliament should pay particular attention to the opinion of the Union’s citizens. An expression of this is the number of petitions submitted to the Committee on Petitions – 114 – which call attention to various aspects of waste management which do not comply with EU law. This shows that it is in the interest of the people who live in the EU for the Member States to bring about implementation of the contents of the directive into national legal systems as quickly as possible. Taking into account the interest of the European Union as a whole and of individual citizens, I call upon the Member States to adapt their national legal systems to the contents of the directive.</literal>

               –Rapid and dynamic economic growth is inevitably associated with a threat to the natural environment. Therefore, the European Union and, in particular, the European Parliament, must also set standards for environment protection which will be appropriate in a changing economic reality. A definite step forward on this matter was the implementation by the Member States of the Waste Management Directive, the objective of which was to improve and raise the standard of the management, processing and storage of waste. This was imperative in view of the huge amount – over 2 million tonnes – of rubbish processed in the Union every year. However, as is evident from the numerous petitions which are received by the Committee on Petitions and from the fact-finding visits which have been made and which are discussed exhaustively by Mr Iturgaiz Angulo in his report, we can conclude beyond doubt that the objective of the directive has only been achieved in part. For this reason, it is essential that further effort be made by the entire Union to eliminate cases of non-compliance with, or incorrect performance of, the provisions of the directive. In addition, we cannot forget that the ultimate effect of this work in large measure needs the cooperation and commitment of society and requires that those who violate our common good bear responsibility for their actions.</literal>

               –Mr President, the Daphne programme is the only EU programme intended to contribute to protecting children, young people and women from all forms of violence.

This programme has been a genuine success since its launch in 1997, both in terms of its stakeholders and in terms of the effectiveness of the projects funded by the programme. The report that we are now discussing, on the progress made and the future prospects for the Daphne programme, was adopted almost unanimously in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, with only one abstention.

Work with the other political groups has been very fruitful, so I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for the very positive contributions that they made to this report.

Combating violence against children, young people and women remains a priority and is, unfortunately, still necessary. This is clear from the new forms of violence that have emerged recently with the growing use of social media, violence at day nurseries, ill-treatment of the elderly and sexual assault among teenagers. Moreover, in the current situation of economic crisis and budgetary austerity, there is a need to avoid the direct financial impact which this type of crime has on the judiciary and on health and social services.

The costs of domestic violence in the EU have been estimated at EUR 16 billion per year, including all direct medical costs, court and police costs, social costs and economic costs.

Last November, the Commission announced that from 2014, the Daphne programme will be incorporated into the rights and citizenship programme. We must admit that we would have preferred this programme to remain independent and autonomous. As this is not an option, I would point out three concerns: firstly, safeguarding the aims of the programme for the 2014-2020 period; secondly, keeping its funding at the same level as that of previous programmes; and, thirdly, ensuring its visibility within the future rights and citizenship programme.

If this programme is to remain effective, it is vital to ensure that its beneficiaries, public authorities and non-governmental organisations continue to be kept properly informed about how it is funded and conditions for accessing it. Small organisations, which, by their nature, have more direct contact with phenomena of violence, often have administrative problems, and should be able to participate fully, as they play a vital role in detecting these problems and coming up with innovative ways of tackling them.

The balanced sharing out of projects between all the Member States should be taken into account. Moreover, the collection of comparable data on different types of violence in the EU is very useful in ascertaining the real level of the problem and finding appropriate solutions.

I shall conclude by stressing the importance of using the media to raise awareness of violence in the fields of education and health, and among the police and the judiciary.</literal>

I should emphasise the importance of paragraph G. The economic crisis is making women more vulnerable to abuse. In my country, the Open Doors programme is currently being run, cofinanced by the European Commission through the Daphne III programme. It is part of a partnership with Austria, the UK, the Czech Republic, Greece and Slovenia. It is aimed at immigrant women who have been victims of violence. This initiative offers them the chance to become integrated into Romanian society, while also being community leaders in this area.</literal>

  –Mr President, now it is my turn to congratulate Ms Bastos on her report, which, I believe, is very comprehensive and tackles all the questions raised in the Commission’s interim evaluation report. Clearly, this report focuses on the involvement of NGOs and small entities, on improved management, and on anything which effectively allows the objectives of the programme to be maintained.

Obviously, I do have some regrets. Firstly, I regret that a debate has not really been organised today on this report, as that would have allowed us to bring the focus back to the violence which still affects young people, women and children everywhere. I particularly regret this because, if I have understood correctly, there is a certain desire to remove several references to prostitution and the violation of women’s rights in terms of sexual and reproductive health. Clearly, there are therefore things which have still to be resolved, which are not totally clear from various people’s remarks.

I have run out of time to talk about prevention and education about stereotypes.

I should like to finish with two issues we must be vigilant about: firstly, maintaining the amount allocated to the Daphne programme and, secondly, ensuring that the name of this programme, which is widely known, will be kept in the future.</literal>

  –Mr President, the crisis should, indeed, not be an excuse for a lack of investment in a solution to one of the main problems faced by the European Union as a whole. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that the crisis is also an excuse, in many respects, to reinforce certain aspects that lead to even more violence against women. For me, this is, in fact, one of the fundamental debates that we have to tackle in this House, and not simply from an economic standpoint.

It has been said, and it is true, that the violence also generates a significant economic cost. Beyond the economic cost generated by the violence and the obvious consequences, however, we are also going to debate this in depth, as has been proposed.

This debate cannot be used for issues of an ideological nature, which can even result in the generation of a dynamic for the stigmatisation of women, which, in turn, will also obviously place them in a vulnerable situation and therefore make them more susceptible to violent situations, if that were possible.

I insist that this is a good opportunity to continue debating what currently needs to be discussed, but without forgetting the underlying issue, which is the fundamental discrimination that women suffer in many parts of our society.</literal>

  –Mr President, I very much support this European Parliament own-initiative report, and I take the view that it is still necessary to continue this important and, at the same time, highly successful programme. Small non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are the driving force in combating violence against women and children, but they often have problems with financing projects aimed at combating violence.

The important thing is for the victims to be provided with professional care in such difficult situations. I therefore take the view that these NGOs should have access to small but clearly targeted grants. I also often encounter the view that small organisations lack the specialists who could draw up the sort of high-quality project plans that would succeed in a tender, and the expertise. I therefore agree with some of the important measures contained in this report. At this point, I would particularly like to mention the equal distribution of programmes throughout the Member States, a reduction in the administrative burden, and simplification of the submission of applications for financial support and funding of the national projects that these small non-profit organisations are involved in.</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Bastos for drafting this report. At a time when future priorities are being discussed, it is important to remember initiatives that have brought results. The Daphne programme is certainly one of them. The Daphne programme is extraordinary because it is able to reach those victims of violence that have been beyond the reach of other institutions.

I mean women and children and adolescents who are exposed to violence due to social exclusion. However, violence is not always a physical blow. It can also be threats, psychological pressure, harassment or the dissemination of images depicting the sexual abuse of children. In particular, these forms of violence threaten the mental integrity of a person. Daphne enables projects to be funded that address the use of Internet networks for new forms of violence. More attention should be paid to prevention and also the financing of small organisations that tackle this issue.</literal>

  – Mr President, I think it is important, as part of the Daphne programme’s incorporation into the rights and citizenship programme, that future initiatives receive a level of focus and funding similar to that provided throughout the previous three Daphne programmes.

I particularly agree that renewed emphasis should be placed on small NGOs and non-profit organisations, whose participation is invaluable if we are to meet the programme’s aims. In my own home country, a number of organisations have participated in Daphne projects and Daphne-funded initiatives that have contributed to the prevention of violence against women, children and young people. These projects range from the Dignity initiative – in which the Dublin Employment Pact and the Immigration Council of Ireland worked with European partners to attempt to raise the quality of services delivered to victims of sex trafficking – to helping establish and promote the pan-European 116000 Hotline for Missing Children. It is vital that the Union continues to support the good work carried out by these organisations and similar organisations all around Europe.</literal>

However, I would like to draw attention to the Commission’s failure to implement across the Union the 116000 Hotline for Missing Children. Children are being put in danger as a result of that failure and the Daphne programme’s work is being undermined in relation to protecting children in all Member States. The hotline is a vitally important tool in protecting children. Currently, the service is not being implemented properly and I urge the Commission to address the operation of the hotline and its role in the Daphne programme.</literal>

               –The aim of the Daphne programme is to combat violence towards women, children and young people. In 2000, the Daphne initiative was transformed into a multiannual programme covering the period 2000-2003, and was allocated funding of EUR 20 million. The Daphne II and Daphne III programmes were launched in 2004 and 2007 respectively, with an average annual budget of EUR 10 million for Daphne II and EUR 16.7 million for Daphne III. Over 500 projects have been implemented since 1997 in a variety of fields, such as sexual, psychological or physical violence in families, schools and other institutions. I have to say, unfortunately, that the new Member States have so far accounted for only a negligible percentage of applications for funding from the Daphne programme. This might, of course, be also due to a lack of awareness among professionals regarding this programme. I would like to urge non-profit organisations, research institutes, public offices, schools and media, as well as all other bodies whose cooperation could be useful in combating violence against women, children and young people, to find out about this EU programme and push for it to be spread, and, in particular, made use of, more widely.</literal>

During the past year I implemented a massive campaign promoting European programmes in Bulgaria including Daphne. I noticed that the lack of information in accessible language and of experience in implementing partner projects influences how active stakeholders are.

Given that Daphne targets one of our society’s serious problems – violence against women, children and young persons – I am of the opinion that the programme’s results have to be made public and used more widely, also with respect to the new risks associated with Internet usage. Violence against children and young people can cause deep psychological and physical trauma impacting their overall development, and we cannot remain indifferent and inactive. The distribution and exchange of information, experience and good practices, the creation of activity networks, campaigns for promoting public awareness and the setting up of hotlines for victims of violence are key measures that have to continue to receive support at European level.</literal>

               –Mr President, I do not believe that I will manage to cover every issue dealt with in the report in the next four minutes. However, I would like to highlight several matters which I regard as being vital.

This report is apt because, unfortunately, the use of rape as a weapon of war was invented by primitive societies, and here we also have it now as a weapon of war in modern, so-called ‘civilised’ societies. It is a topical issue with a significant impact, particularly in social terms, which can modify the pattern of behaviour and the way in which nations respond. Let us merely take the conflict in Congo as an example, where around 16 rapes a day have been recorded, proving that this problem has been far from tackled and eradicated.

In the view of this report, there can be no peace without security and they can only be thought of as going hand in hand with each other. However, they can only be thought of in terms of equal opportunities and of a gender-based approach, jointly created by women and men as part of a partnership, which also concerns conflict prevention and the way in which conflict is conducted and, most of all, the activities involved in peacekeeping and resolving post-conflict situations. The European Union has endeavoured to take vital steps to prevent and tackle this problem. Unfortunately, national plans, as requested, are only available in 10 Member States, with five Member States in the process of devising these plans, proving that we have not made any progress yet and are behind in relation to the objectives we set ourselves. I believe that setting up the European External Action Service gives the European Union the chance to become much more involved in resolving this kind of problem. The report calls for the delegations which are negotiating peace and are involved in conflict to be selected using a gender-sensitive approach and for women to be included in these delegations because their perspective may be helpful in achieving much more quickly and more efficiently what is called peace and social calm.

Another key point in the report concerns impunity. As I said, you cannot have justice without peace. However, unfortunately, the reality is that we have the problem of impunity. Although we can have recourse to the International Criminal Court, I believe that we need to find much more effective legal instruments. In a post-conflict situation, investigations need to be carried out and the perpetrators of these reprehensible criminal acts need to be brought to account because, in any other circumstance, we will end up seriously victimising the people who have suffered such acts and, if you like, society itself. I believe that this partnership between the European Union and the UN must be established not only through implementing Resolution 1960, but through other measures as well. I believe that the European Union has a duty to be a strong partner of the UN in tackling this problem. This is why we are calling for the post of Special EU Representative on Women, Peace and Security to be created within the EEAS. This is not an idle request. On the contrary, it is aimed at showing the European Union’s firm commitment to tackling this problem.

However, we believe that a series of rules also need to be applied to those involved in the process of war and peace. We believe that Member States’ military structures must take into account a gender dimension, not only in terms of numbers, but particularly in terms of quality, because there are, fortunately, women in the European Union who are capable of coping with the highest positions in the military and in civilian life. To achieve this, Member States must consider the gender dimension in their military structures, which is a new issue.

Thank you for your attention. As I said, I did not manage to cover all the topics, but please allow me to make one last point: I must thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the political groups because we all worked together on this report.</literal>

It is essential to guarantee the safety of women who choose to take up the courageous career of working in war situations. In many war zones around the world, sexual violence in the form of mass rapes and other forms of abuse such as human trafficking are often used as a war tactic, women being the main victims. These unacceptable acts have serious psychological and physical repercussions, especially with regard to women and their family members. We must condemn the perpetrators of criminal acts more severely. Impunity must not be negotiable and there should be no peace without justice. It is important to increase the participation of women in decision-making roles during peace processes and when it comes to defining security measures.</literal>

  –Mr President, only limited progress has been made in the last few decades on the participation of women in public administration. In some cases, quotas have been adopted and the number of women in representative institutions has grown. Despite these efforts, however, the participation of women in peace talks, with some exceptions, remains below 10%. Women in the military nevertheless play an important role as role models and mediators of intercultural exchange, and are also an encouraging motivation for local women, breaking down the stereotypes of local men and communicating better with local women.

In most countries, unfortunately, little importance is attached to gender equality and women’s rights because the gender issue is seen only as a minor issue, and cultural, religious and socio-economic customs are often taken as an excuse for hindering progress in this area.

  – Mr President, I think this is a crucial issue, not only because the role of women in war is important as victims and as targeted objectives in that situation, but also because of the role that women can play in peace-building.

Rebuilding societies and changing some of the patterns that have brought some societies to war: this, to me, is one of the crucial issues that we have to underline – not only in the resolution, but also as the United Nations is doing in their Resolutions 1325 and 1820. That is also why it is so important that the European Union has a specific special representative for this issue. As has been said – and I fully support this – there is a huge opportunity for the European Union to put that issue at the forefront of the external dimension of these activities. This is, as has been said, not a minor issue, and it is a huge opportunity that we should not miss.</literal>

  –Mr President, the appalling crimes committed under the cloak of military conflict against women and girls are a clear indication that their rights are not sufficiently protected, despite all efforts to date. Sexual violence in the form of mass rape, human trafficking and other forms of sexual abuse still form part of military tactics in conflict regions worldwide. We cannot tolerate such attacks on human dignity.

I therefore wholeheartedly agree with the rapporteur’s proposals concerning the introduction of a code of behaviour for people serving in military and civilian missions, clearly stating that sexual abuse constitutes unjustifiable and criminal behaviour. It will introduce strict penalties and zero tolerance vis-à-vis sexual abuse of children, girls and women in armed conflicts and in refugee camps. I support the proposals to strengthen the participation of women in leading political dialogue roles. The representation of women in international teams and in civilian and security missions should be a basic precondition for the provision of support within a peace process framework.</literal>

  –Mr President, during World Wars I and II, women lost their husbands and sons on the front. Today, women are the direct victims of conflicts. Removed from their homes, imprisoned and raped, women are particularly vulnerable in these situations.

I am pleased that Parliament has finally called for acts of sexual violence in times of war to be considered war crimes. For this, we must recognise the remarkable work of our rapporteur, Ms Nicolai.

There are two types of consequences for the victims: physical and psychological. However, these acts of violence also have a much wider impact: an impact on men, who have not been able to protect their wives, an impact on children, and an impact on the community. The effects of war therefore extend over time and across generations.

I welcome all of the solutions presented today in this report. Women have a role to play in conflict resolution and in political dialogues for peace. They have a role to play not only in civil conflict resolution missions, but also in military ones.

Finally, I believe that our Union will gain from having a Special Representative on Women, Peace and Security. My question, Commissioner, is the following: can you foresee the creation of such a position? If so, when?</literal>

I agree with the rapporteur that war criminals who commit offences against women must be brought to trial more quickly, with impunity being non-negotiable in these cases. Unfortunately, in conflict situations currently going on around the world, violence is used against women as a war tactic and, regrettably, these cases most often remain unreported and unpunished. This is precisely why I believe that the European External Action Service must appoint a special observer with the job of protecting women in conflict zones and against any form of sexual or gender-based violence.</literal>

Parliament has often been alarmed by the deteriorating situation, particularly in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and by the widespread impunity.

I visited South Kivu, in particular, some time ago. I can testify to the gravity of the situation and the devastating physical and psychological consequences for women and young girls as a result of such acts. Let us not choose the wrong battle. In the face of such atrocities, reproductive and sexual health should be dealt with without taboo.

The Union must grant a central place in its actions to reproductive and sexual health and the protection of women’s rights in terms of sexuality during times of war. We know that rape is a crime. During war, it is a war crime. Therefore, women – we must always remember – are not an instrument of war.</literal>

At present, fewer than 10% of peace negotiators are women, although peace is in the interests of everyone – men and women.

Wars and conflict affect women in many ways. One of the most brutal practices is sexual violence as a form of warfare. It affects everything: the victim’s physical and mental health, family relations, and her entire future. In the majority of cases, the guilty go unpunished. The victim, on the other hand, lives with it all her life.

               – In order to encourage their participation in situations of war, women must be visible contributors to the prevention, mediation and resolution of conflicts. Beyond engaging in behind-the-scenes roles, assuming leadership roles is key to building upon the foundation of gender equality. As women account for half of the EU population, it is logical that their participation in these three phases mirrors this statistic. Aside from this simple democratic principle, what is perhaps the strongest argument for women’s participation is the unique perspective they bring to the table and the message their empowerment sends to the world. Women need to be better represented in the military, for example, not just to fill a proportional requirement, but also because they interact and communicate more effectively with local women. On the other spectrum, local women’s empowerment must be strengthened. Education is a crucial means through which local women can gain integrity and be better equipped to engineer preventive measures against war and violence in their communities. In addition to the active participation of a proportional representation of women at the negotiation table, women’s knowledge is also critical in the peace-building process as women are more aware of the challenges faced by their communities.</literal>

               –Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for working together so constructively. I would particularly like to thank Mr Lehne and Ms Thein, but also Mr Boulland, the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, who contributed interesting, very useful aspects relating to the transfer plan and the participation of employees and their representatives.

The draft report was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, and the opinion was adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with an overwhelming majority. That should therefore serve as a wake-up call to the Commission to finally table legislation, because we are dealing with sensitive matters here: the issue of company seats and that of worker participation.

A limited company that wishes to move its seat from one EU Member State to another faces a challenge. In legal terms, it has to dismantle its organisation completely in order to build it up again in another Member State. It has to give up its legal personality – and that in 2012, when we are supposed to have an internal market. That costs time and money and no little irritation; there are also social costs associated with it. There is therefore a real gap in the legislation, and the European Parliament is aware of that. It has also repeatedly called on the Commission in the past to finally table legislation.

What are the consequences for enterprises? They simply take flight. Competition has arisen between the corporate forms that exist under national legislation – limited company versus, to name just one of many examples. They rush into mergers; in other words, there is a race to the bottom. I do not want that. We do not want a ‘Delaware effect’. That means we need a directive: a 14th company law directive on the transfer of company seats. However, company seats should be transferred properly, not cowboy fashion. I do not want companies to frantically decamp – with half of them getting lost along the way. Enterprises must not be allowed to more or less erase all traces of their existence and abandon their commitments in the Member State they are leaving when they transfer their company seat.

This brings us to the two main issues here. I will start with the matter of employees’ participation. Employees’ participation contributes to the enduring success of companies. Employee rights in line with the Community– that is what my report calls for. That means respecting the right to information and consultation, as well as codetermination by employees and their representatives.this means – and I call on the Commission to do this – that where appropriate, negotiations on rescue arrangements are required to protect existing codetermination rights. I already have a best practice example in mind here. We already have rules in connection with the European company.

Let us now move on to the second hot potato that we are dealing with here: the issue of registered offices and administrative seats. Within the European Union, there are countries that allow separation between the registered office and the administrative seat of a company, and there are those that do not. Allowing such separation encourages the avoidance of mandatory protective standards that apply in the country in which the company has its administrative seat – in other words, the centre of its operations.

The report sets out that we do not want companies to be tax exiles or to misuse post-box offices with a view to circumventing legal, social and fiscal conditions. What we want is a practical solution. In the report, we have found a Solomon-like solution. Commissioner, please ask Commissioner Barnier – who has responsibility for this – to at last act on this and, in so doing, to concentrate on the key issue, on the intra-Community transfers of seats; in other words, on those political areas which, in the final event, all the Member States can agree on. It should be based on economic activity in the state to which the company is relocating.

The internal market has a contribution to make to economic growth – something we need now more than ever. Please do not delay, then, in finally tabling a proposal; and please do not repeat the mistakes made when the European company was set up.</literal>

  –Mr President, cross-border company migration is one of the crucial elements in the completion of the internal market, and Articles 49 and 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guarantee European companies the freedom to become established anywhere within the European Union. However, the lack of consistent legislation on transfers and on procedures for transferring a company’s registered office and the associated risk in terms of employment, the administrative difficulties, the costs incurred, the social implications and the lack of legal certainty all hamper the transfer process.

We call on the Commission to table a proposal for a directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats, so that the transfer takes place only after a company’s management or board of directors planning a transfer has drafted a transfer plan on which the relevant company’s employees have also been consulted. I think that the e-government services and single points of contact created under the Services Directive can ease the administrative burden of company transfers.</literal>

  –Mr President, I very much appreciate what Ms Regner has done and support her call. The legislative initiative on the issue of the transfer of company seats is very necessary. Freedom of entrepreneurship is important, but if a company seat is transferred without also moving the other activities of the company to the new location at the same time, unfair practices are usually at work. In most cases, this is an attempt to avoid tax obligations or to circumvent labour law in the home country.

The creation of so-called mailbox companies, with which we also have experience in the EU Member States, is certainly an undesirable phenomenon that needs to be addressed. Of course, legislation should be able to discern and should not prevent honest companies from changing location if necessary and provided there is a legitimate reason. A good control mechanism promoted by our grouping is to involve company employees in decision making on the cross-border transfer of company seats, for example, through their effective participation in the boards of companies.</literal>

               –I believe that in essence, the 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats serves to strengthen the EU’s competitiveness. A prerequisite of competitiveness is dynamic and flexible company law. As we could see, not even an extensive interpretation of the most important judgments is sufficient to dispel all doubts that have arisen in connection with the freedom of establishment and ensure full legal certainty. Yet this is exactly what business life needs. Unlike restrictions, however, a regulatory competition arising at the level of company and fiscal law as a result of the freedom to choose seats could promote the competitiveness of the EU as a whole. As enterprises are free to choose where to have their seats, Member States will have to adapt their regulations in line with one another in order to avoid an exodus of companies choosing more favourable legal conditions. This would lead to indirect harmonisation within the Community. The question that remains is where do we go from here. By now, it has become clear that any criticism questioning the future andof this directive on a level of principles has proven to be unfounded. It is also apparent, however, that the regulatory framework established is not without faults. Its future fate will be determined by its usefulness and actual use.</literal>

               –I hope that today’s own-initiative report will be interpreted by the Commission in the way it was written by Parliament, because a directive on the transfer of company seats could have considerable negative effects on the rules on corporate codetermination. That applies not just to Germany, but throughout the European Union. The transfer of a company’s registered office could result in the loss of codetermination at corporate level. Transferring the company’s registered office to another country could allow the rules on corporate codetermination in Germany to be circumvented. At present, employees’ codetermination in a company is based on the Member State in which the company has its registered office. We are not talking about a nominal registered office; rather, the company must be registered where it actually has a genuine presence, such as business premises, employees, etc. In other words, it must have a genuine link with the state in which it is registered. We cannot allow the directive on transfers of company seats to be used to circumvent the rights of employees and creditors through the establishment of post-box offices abroad. If separation between the registered office and the administrative seat of a company is allowed, then social rights could effectively be eroded – and that is something we have to prevent. This can only work if the registered office of a company is in the country where it is actually based. That is the way to safeguard effectively the rights of employees in the European Union.

I hope the Commission will safeguard social Europe, and the rights of its citizens, in its draft legislation.</literal>

               –Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the beginning of 2012 is a timely occasion for the report on universal energy access, as the United Nations General Assembly has designated 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All.

To me and to all my fellow Members who worked with me on this report in committee, two facts are particularly important. The first is that we want renewable energy. The second is that we want everyone to have access to these new sources of energy. Consequently, these sources of energy must be affordable by everyone.

In the Committee on Development, we worked together very constructively, including with NGOs. In this connection, particular mention must be made of the London-based organisation, Practical Action, and of Sweden’s Stockholm Environment Institute. Our secretariat also provided us with vigorous support in finding ways in which we can forge ahead with universal access to renewable energy.

Allow me to clarify once more what we are talking about here. At present, 1.3 billion people live without electricity. A total of 2.7 billion people use biomass to cook, on improvised stoves. The vast majority of these live in rural areas, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and India. To give just one example: 20% of the population of Kenya has access to the grid, but only 5% of the rural population.

Access to energy brings not only light and power, but also – and above all – cooking facilities and heating. Yet access to energy is still not a Millennium Development Goal. Without access to it, however, it will be difficult to achieve our Millennium Development Goals. That is why we call in the report for renewable energy to be included in the post-2015 MDGs.

It is hard to see how schools, training facilities, health centres and hospitals could exist or function without electricity. Cooking and heating with biomass causes millions of deaths each year in shacks, as a result of harmful smoke. Many of Africa’s governments have therefore banned the use of coal for cooking and heating, for climate and health reasons. In practice, however, those responsible have to look the other way when coal is produced and sold.

We very much welcome the fact that, in its Agenda for Change, the Commission has included energy as a guiding priority. Allow me, therefore, to summarise our key demands in the report once more. We call on the EU and the Member States to support the UN goals of universal access to energy by 2030 and to align their policies accordingly. We call on the Commission to focus on small, local renewable energy projects, because only then will it be possible to reach the majority of the population. More money should be made available for this. The European Investment Bank and the other European development banks are not geared towards small, local energy projects. That has to change; universal energy access should be prominently represented in the Rio+20 process. Finally, universal energy access should be included as a Millennium Development Goal post-2015.</literal>

In this regard, energy access ought to become a priority as part of the debate on eradicating poverty. I should point out that difficulties in accessing modern energy services put women and children in particular at a disadvantage.

I support the inclusion of this problem on the Rio+20 summit agenda in June. I endorse the notion of devising a specific EU-level energy and development programme. At the same time, private investment must be encouraged, so as to make these services more accessible to the public. I should stress the importance of funding for projects involving renewable electricity sources. For example, in Romania, producers of green energy are due to receive EUR 300 million this year from green certificates.</literal>

We have undoubtedly made fantastic technological progress in renewable energy. Such progress was unthinkable 20 years ago, so making access to renewable energy one of our goals for 2015 is very appropriate.

We are all aware of the destruction of part of the forests of sub-Saharan Africa in order for its biomass to be used as the one and only fuel. New solutions need to be devised. However, in Europe, too, we have, in large measure, based renewable energy and its funding on being completely paid for by users. This is now under attack from everyone, in particular, because of the crisis that we are experiencing and the nuclear lobby. We therefore support the Commission in these measures.</literal>

In my opinion, what the European Union most needs right now is diversification of sources. This involves targeting new forms of alternative energy, such as genetic manipulation of bacteria, where research is under way in the US, for example, into the direct production of diesel through this technique. It also involves strengthening interconnectivity and building up reserves. In my opinion, this is an option we have neglected so far.</literal>

  –Mr President, among developing countries, energy poverty represents a serious issue. Nearly 1.3 billion people worldwide regularly go without electricity in their everyday lives.

I believe that so far, this issue has not been given sufficient weight among development priorities. Access to modern energy services is an essential requirement of eradicating poverty, yet there are few developing countries that can demonstrate any progress in improving access to energy. Households usually spend large proportions of their income on low-quality lighting and heating materials. The reason for this is that those without access to fuel and electricity do not receive subsidies.

Today, there is already a range of technologies available that could give poor communities access to clean and efficient energy. Technologies that make use of local energy sources in addition to fossil fuels could also offer a solution. The creation of a global financial fund that would allow us to support investments aimed at mitigating poverty should be facilitated. We must do everything in our power, both at a political level and in terms of financial support, to ensure universal access to energy by 2030.</literal>

The task of improving energy access requires an estimated annual investment of USD 48 billion by 2030, which is equivalent to around 3% of the global investment in energy infrastructure projected over the period until then. I think that providing universal access to modern, sustainable energy services is a prerequisite for achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

  –Mr President, access to modern energy services is a fundamental prerequisite for poverty reduction and stable, sustainable human development. Without access to energy, whole communities are constrained to a life of poverty under undignified conditions. Substantial efforts have been made to foster private investment for energy access in recent years. However, aside from the economies in transition, very few developing countries can demonstrate progress on scaling-up access to energy for the poor. Financial assistance to energy access for this group of the population has been modest, and it is therefore necessary to increase private sector involvement.

Regarding the future, globally, the Energy Facility provides the only fund specifically focused on supporting investments to challenge energy poverty.

               –The lack of access to electricity is not only a serious problem at a global level, affecting around 1.3 billion people, but even in some European Union Member States, too. In Romania, for example, many isolated rural areas are not connected to the electricity grid, which has resulted in an alarming level of depopulation in the localities in these parts of the country. In fact, the lack of roads or sewage systems also causes rural areas to be abandoned. In these circumstances, it is important to retain the second pillar as part of the future common agricultural policy, which is devoted to rural development and, in particular, to maintain, as part of it, the opportunity for funding investments in infrastructure, whether it be electricity, gas or road.</literal>

               –Energy services influence every aspect of people’s lives and the sources of people’s support. Without unrestricted access to these services, societies are forced to live in want. Worldwide, about 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. This is a huge problem for the countries of the developing world. However, apart from this, there is also another problem, which affects the people living in the European Union itself and, in particular, the Union’s new Member States, and this concerns the restricted access to electricity caused by the high costs of this form of energy. This phenomenon occurs mainly in rural areas, and this is why it is of such great importance to strengthen the EU Energy Facility, which supports marginalised rural areas and people living in isolated communities.

Supporting renewable energy sources and investing in them should become the main work of the Union in this area. The objective is obvious: to ensure inexpensive energy services for the poor, and particularly for all people in non-urban areas. In Central and Eastern Europe, including in countries such as Lithuania, many hectares of land are not under cultivation. By supporting initiatives to derive energy from biofuels, we would gain a triple benefit: cheaper energy, restoration of agricultural production and a reduction in unemployment through the creation of new jobs in the agriculture sector. The role of the Union should be to draw up clear guidelines on criteria for funding and supporting the production of biofuels and alternative energy sources.</literal>

               –Mr President, Commissioner, it was with a high degree of humility that I took on the task as rapporteur for this report, the first annual tax report. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from all groups for the constructive debate that we had on this difficult but important subject. I have tried to incorporate comments from all groups, and I think that we have been able to achieve a high level of agreement. I hope this report will receive broad support here in this Chamber today.

The subject of taxes and tax policy is one that affects people. Tax policy generates emotion – both positive and negative. There are conflicting aims within tax policy, and we always have to find a balance between them. We know that it is not the easiest thing to do. For decades, tax policy has been regarded as an exclusively national matter in which the EU has no part to play. That time is past, however. As a consequence of globalisation, tax issues also need to be discussed at EU level.

The report aims to examine the areas where further coordination of taxes – in certain areas perhaps even tax harmonisation – may be necessary, and where the EU can play an important role. Comprehensive and lasting budgetary consolidation is needed, because the ongoing debt crisis is also a tax crisis. The lack of coordination of tax policy is contributing to a deepening of the crisis. The necessary, but painful, reduction of debt requires expenditure restraints, increased cuts in public spending and also tax rises.

This report focuses on areas where the EU can do more to improve the functioning of the internal market and to make Europe more competitive. Unfortunately, companies and citizens within the EU are still encountering tax obstacles. We need to remove these obstacles in order to create economic growth and more jobs. In order to be able to do that, we need to reduce taxes on earnings and increase taxes on consumption, for example.

I also hope that the report will be able to put pressure on the Member States to adopt the tax proposals that the Commission has put forward, including the introduction of a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB). We need to resolve the tax problems that people encounter in their day-to-day lives; for example, if they live in one country and work in another and are affected by double taxation. Tax treaties between Member States are, in themselves, not enough to eradicate double taxation. This is a consequence of the lack of a consistent interpretation of the treaties between the countries.

Several cases of double taxation are currently being examined in the Committee on Petitions. One example concerns an Italian lorry driver who works in Germany and was taxed in both Italy and Germany. He had to pay a total of 60% of his wages in tax, despite the fact that he should only have been taxed in Germany and should only have paid 25% in tax. This happened despite there being a tax treaty between Germany and Italy and despite the fact that the tax authorities have established that this is an error. As far as I know, this case is still not fully resolved, unfortunately. We need a common EU policy in this area and joint legislation that is able to make a distinction. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has recently adopted a communication on double taxation, which also presents practical measures.

Tax evasion, fraud and lack of transparency cost the EU and its Member States many billions of euro in lost tax revenue every year. I am particularly concerned about the exploitation of loopholes in European legislation, whereby international companies operating within the EU attempt to avoid paying tax within the Union. The aim must be for every euro in tax that is intentionally withheld from the state through clever tax arrangements to be paid to the tax authority in future.

In closing, I would just like to say that paragraph 11, which concerns fiscal federalism, has caused a certain amount of confusion. Allow me to read the original proposal in English, which came from my Basque and Catalan colleagues, among others:

‘Believes that fiscal federalism is the best tool in order to achieve self-responsibility in tax management at regional level and so entails higher economic efficiency’. That refers to paragraph 11.</literal>

  –Mr President, it is definitely welcome that the European Parliament is providing its opinion on current European tax policy issues. The report correctly assesses the importance of the coordination of tax policies in terms of information exchange, as the absence of such coordination could, in the long term, indeed entail a lack of transparency in taxation and the risk of tax evasion. However, this, in itself, means far more than a deficit of millions of euro because, in time, the very single market and the unimpeded operation of cross-border companies could be at risk.

It must be noted, however, that while tax policy rightly continues to remain within national competence, Member States must cooperate in making their tax policies, which also represent major budgetary revenues to them, transparent and comparable, and must also cooperate in making both the tax collection system and the tax planning strategies applied measurable and comparable.

However, in order for Europe to be competitive in terms of its various tax policies in combating tax evasion and double taxation, it needs to involve not only the OECD but also the European Community itself more actively.</literal>

  –Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Schmidt for his excellent report and for the constructive cooperation that we enjoyed. He made reference to the euro crisis – the debt crisis – which compels us all to consider how we can better integrate our economy. It goes without saying that, when it comes to taxation, too, we need to better integrate with each other, especially within the euro area, but also within the European Union as a whole.

For my group, this implies fairer taxation. It means eliminating tax evasion and avoidance internally within the European Union, but, of course, it also means a joint strategy for the European Union vis-à-vis third countries. In that connection, we are also arguing for a joint European approach to solving this problem, in other words, agreements between the European Union and Switzerland and other third countries, rather than between the individual Member States of the Union and countries like Switzerland.

Of course, we also need measures such as a shifting of taxation from work to the environment and assets, Community taxation instruments such as a financial transaction tax and, finally, a harmonisation of tax scales, specifically with regard to corporation tax. I think that that is very important indeed.</literal>

  –Mr President, I wish to express my satisfaction that Parliament, through this annual tax report, has supported the principle of fiscal federalism that forms part of the economic agreement between the Basque country and Navarre. Devolved income generating powers, as well as devolved spending powers, promote responsibility, prevent deficit, and encourage the development of effective policies to support a productive economy. Likewise, support for Member State legislation in this matter is essential for the regions that already have fiscal powers devolved and for those that are calling for them to be devolved.

Our support for the principle of fiscal federalism is enhanced by our agreement with the principles of financial stability, our support for the economic governance package and for tax harmonisation. We would, however, like the regional and state tax systems to be treated in the same manner, given that in the Basque country, we experience the paradox of facing sanctions from Europe for applying tax incentives identical to those employed during the same period by some Member States against whom penalty proceedings have not even been started. I am all for harmonisation, but it should be applied across the board.</literal>

I think that those State competences are strong enough and that many countries are not interested in moving towards such a procedure.

I do believe, however, that we could start to work on a common account plan. I think that it is necessary to create common, multilingual accounting forms that would be accepted and assessed in different languages by different tax offices in the individual countries. Then, on the basis of harmonised accounting procedures and accounting forms, we could start to discuss how to define a common tax base, which it may be appropriate to define.

I think that taxes will remain in the competences and, I might add, interests of the individual countries for a long time to come, and I believe that this will also have to be respected.</literal>

At a time highlighted by a high level of mobility among European citizens, I think that special rules need to be adopted immediately for cross-border and mobile workers, which take into account the interaction of tax and social security systems in different Member States.

  –Mr President, the current economic and financial crisis has led to a significant rise in public debt in Europe and, in this context, the automatic stabilisers of the welfare state become more relevant than ever. Effective taxation is of fundamental importance for public authorities so that they can fulfil their tasks and obligations as well as citizens’ expectations. Sound fiscal consolidation, together with fairer and more targeted distribution of the tax burden, is necessary to ensure fiscal credibility. The reduction of debt requires both expenditure restraint and tax increases, especially for high income groups. Growth-oriented tax changes must be given priority. Only in this way will the foundations for long-term growth be created.

It is therefore necessary to try to apply procedures that help prevent tax avoidance and tax abuse. Last but not least, we must also increase transparency.</literal>

Effective taxation helps public authorities fulfil their obligations as well as citizens’ expectations. The Commission and Member States must continue their cooperation against double taxation, tax fraud and tax evasion in order to increase transparency and reduce loopholes and uncertainties for businesses and citizens with regard to tax collection.

I should emphasise that this mechanism adds to the global fiscal burden and has an adverse impact on capital investments. It jeopardises the competitiveness of European companies in the medium and long term. Double taxation conventions may help resolve these problems.

               –Mr President, humanitarian aid is a very, very important matter. Together, the European Union and its Member States are the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid. The Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO) administers around 36% of these resources, which, in 2010, amounted to around EUR 1.1 billion. ECHO merely plays a coordinating role in this, while implementation on the ground is generally carried out by partners; this means that NGOs, UN agencies – in some cases – and international organisations are responsible for implementation.

The fact is that humanitarian aid is intended for the world’s most needy people, and therefore any inefficiency and ineffectiveness costs human lives. That was the starting point for my own-initiative report. After seven years, it is high time that the European Parliament reinvestigated the effectiveness and efficiency of control mechanisms, monitoring mechanisms and, in the final event, the implementation of the aid concerned.

Where cooperation between DG ECHO and the NGOs is concerned, it can be stated that, overall, DG ECHO ensures a very high degree of accountability. Very good continuous dialogue takes place between the NGOs and DG ECHO. Moreover, the 2008 framework partnership agreement has brought definite progress. This is being revised this year, and naturally we should continue along this path. It is also important that we focus in future on reducing administrative expenses.

I am somewhat more critical of our cooperation with the UN. Here, serious shortcomings can be found in the joint budget implementation method as regards reliable control of the management of financial resources.

In my opinion, the ‘single audit’ principle is basically correct. Nonetheless, we have to emphasise transparency. That means, firstly, that the European Parliament should have access to all the UN audit reports. This is not the case at present. In my opinion, the European Parliament is unable to discharge its duties as a control body adequately as a result.

Secondly, the narrative reports sent to the Commission in respect of implementation are worded very vaguely, in my view, where results are concerned. They should contain more substance.

Thirdly, we come to the matter of UN reform. This reform was initiated following the scandal involving the government of North Korea. In respect of transparency and accountability, no progress has yet been made. The Member States surely have a duty to exert more pressure on the UN in this regard.

Where implementation by NGOs is concerned, there are a few weak areas – particularly as regards the contract award procedure of certain NGOs. These are not adequate and, in some cases, NGOs do not have a contract award procedure at all. Internal control mechanisms are also deficient. Although NGOs or partners may also delegate tasks here, they themselves bear the responsibility for how these funds are managed. It is therefore important that there are appropriate internal control mechanisms for this.

There is a strong variation in support costs for similar projects. Perhaps a uniform benchmark ought to be set for projects of a particular type, to rule out this being due to ineffectiveness or inefficiency.

It is undoubtedly important that we continue to focus in future on sustainability and prevention. In the case of disaster preparedness, for example, early warning systems should be built up. In addition, we need to improve the transition phase between humanitarian aid and development aid. Finally, it is also important that the resilience of the local population is strengthened by building up local structures.

The report was adopted with a large majority in committee, and naturally I would be very pleased to see a majority in favour of this report today in plenary.</literal>

  –Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we have a report which shows that the European Union has shouldered a great responsibility in the world. The aid measures that we provide should indeed be sustainable and, in this respect, we should aim, above all, for our aid measures to actually provide the population with a return on the investment. That is why the new development strategy also involves looking at how we can make energy available to the poorest of the poor regions, because in the final event, access to energy is crucial for the training and education required by the population, and because communication is the basis of a successful strategy, and we therefore need to look at how we shape our world’s resources sustainably.

Another measure being proposed is to increase the Emergency Aid Reserve to EUR 2.5 billion for the same period, as well as the proposal for unspent funds in the reserve to be carried over to the following year. I think that the EU budget must support actions designed to anticipate disasters, avert them and react quickly to them, making it easier to initiate actions for emerging from crisis situations.

  –Mr President, I would like to emphasise that one of the preconditions for ensuring the effective and useful administration of financial resources, and for ensuring the efficient provision of humanitarian and development aid, is an overall assessment of the needs created by a specific crisis in a given region.

There is still much room for improvement in this area, as can be seen from the situation in the Horn of Africa, where there has been no visible progress, despite the extensive humanitarian aid. Significant resources are nonetheless still being poured into this region, although there is uncertainty over who are the real beneficiaries. There are no processes or criteria available for identifying the final beneficiaries, on the basis of which it would be possible to define in a more concrete way the volume of resources that could be effectively provided, whether within the framework of humanitarian or development aid. I therefore consider it important that the European Parliament report is devoted to an actual audit of the provision of this aid as a whole, as well as an audit of cooperation with other organisations providing aid, including the UN.</literal>

The Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, which is responsible for carrying out this activity on behalf of the European Union, works with more than two hundred partner organisations with different structures. On the basis of framework agreements, considerable funds are thus provided to the partner organisations for helping the victims of various disasters. The control mechanisms for the meaningful and effective use of funds by these organisations must therefore be an important aspect of the work of our administration.

The Commission’s proposal to improve the supervision processes of the effective management of European taxpayers’ funds for humanitarian aid should therefore be seen as an effort to eliminate the deficiencies of the current model of control in order to achieve a more efficient use of these EU funds in the future.</literal>

At the same time, the EU budget earmarked for humanitarian aid and civil protection is constantly growing. In this regard, good financial management is vital because the EU needs to have a more realistic humanitarian fund. I should emphasise the need to maintain the balance between financing actions designed to anticipate disasters and emergency aid. Europe must have formal mechanisms to prevent any abuses in this area. Transparent cooperation with international organisations is important. At the same time, the EU must ensure consistency between humanitarian aid and development aid; otherwise, it could have an adverse impact on local markets.

However, I would like to emphasise the need, the cogent need, to ensure more transparent mechanisms for the management of funds.

The accusation that, if they become a regular source of income for warring parties, aid deliveries allow wars to be continued – in other words, that they feed the very suffering that causes humanitarian aid to become necessary – has to be taken seriously. The payment of tolls to local warlords in order to be allowed access to the needy population, for example, is a rotten compromise. It can also be problematic if refugee camps indirectly advance ethnic cleansing or become a target for military attacks. Aid organisations become questionable if they scarcely coordinate with each other, merely so that each organisation can gain donors’ funds for itself and have exclusive media coverage in its area of operations. Better coordination of humanitarian operations could have prevented a great deal of suffering in Haiti. Moreover, we need to find practical methods for the transition from humanitarian aid to development aid. When there are scandals such as funds trickling away, blatant abuses of power or ‘jobs for the boys’, we must stop blaming these on so-called black sheep or individual workers. Instead, we must nip them in the bud, for corruption spreads wherever there is little risk of discovery and punishment. It is time for the EU, as the largest humanitarian donor, to deal with these problems once and for all.</literal>

  ,–Our role and duty as the European Parliament is to maintain the principle of sound budgetary management of financial assistance granted by the EU, via the Community budget, from European taxpayers’ money. The need to abide by this principle should apply equally to aid granted to the Member States of the Union and to third countries, especially those facing the whole spectrum of humanitarian crisis. This being so, I support the call on the European Commission to further improve the efficacy and effectiveness of the ECHO control, monitoring and supervision system. As far as efficacy and effectiveness during the implementation of humanitarian aid managed by ECHO are concerned, I endorse the recommendations formulated in the report that the Commission should continue in its efforts to create a better coordinated and more coherent needs assessment system. Finally, I agree that the European Parliament should have access to the final audit reports of ECHO partners on the implementation of humanitarian actions.

It is because of this respect that I wish to bring this point of order. In my candidacy for the office of President, I stood in part to protect Rule 20(3) of the Rules of Procedure and to ensure that the President of our Parliament would always be impartial. The Rule in question states that ‘The President may speak in a debate only to sum up or to call speakers to order. Should he wish to take part in a debate, he shall vacate the chair and shall not reoccupy it until the debate is over’.

Regardless of what was said yesterday to Mr Farage, some of which I do not necessarily agree with, I would like your firm assurance that you will respect Rule 20(3) in the future and be the President for all of us, every single Member, regardless of group or nationality.</literal>

  – Madam President, the report on the EU’s foreign policy towards Brazil, Russia, India and China (the BRICS), and other emerging powers including Turkey, Indonesia and Mexico, rightly acknowledges the increasing role these countries play in our foreign policy and the increasing contribution they are making to the global economy. We have also seen an increased participation in cooperation in the policies of the BRICS and the emerging powers on an international level, and this is to be encouraged at all times.

We can now see the development of a multipolar system where economic and political power is distributed between a number of blocs. It is for this reason that I support the report’s proposal for the development of a coherent EU approach, to treat the BRICS as a single bloc, and to also seek to establish partnerships with each of the countries within the bloc, which will prove to be invaluable when responding to global challenges such as climate change, terrorism and, of course, the financial crisis.</literal>

We sell more to Belgium than we sell to the whole of China’. I replied, ‘That is precisely the problem’. Which is the better long-term prospect?

When we joined the European Union in 1973, we had the impression that we were hitching our wagons to a powerful locomotive. Western Europe had indeed grown spectacularly in the years following 1945. It had far outperformed the United Kingdom, burdened as it was with the enormous debt-to-GDP ratio that it had at the end of the Second World War.

But we can now see in retrospect that our timing could hardly have been worse. In relative terms, Western Europe stopped growing in the oil crisis of 1974 and never really got going again. We foolishly stood aside from the parts of the world which are still developing, where the growth still is, not least the Anglosphere and Commonwealth markets to which we are tied by habit, blood and speech. We are cabined, cribbed, confined in a dwindling customs union. We should raise our eyes to the broader, brighter and more distant horizons that our fathers took for granted.</literal>

I support good relations with the countries individually but I am under no illusion that China remains a one-party dictatorship, Russia has an authoritarian government which openly tolerates high-level corruption, whereas India and Brazil are liberal democracies with the same fundamental values, legal checks and balances and freedoms as EU Member States. My group is particularly keen on advocating stronger trade links through deep and comprehensive free trade agreements with both India and Brazil – the latter ideally through Mercosur, as Latin America enjoys the same growth rate of about 8% as China, and has a collective economy roughly the same size as China’s, but is totally different by sharing our common democratic values.</literal>

There is a space for closer cooperation between the EU and the BRICS countries. This is especially relevant at a time when BRICS countries are showing their clear ambitions in foreign policy terms. From this point of view, it will be important to bring the emerging economic powers to take a different role in international development policy. In my opinion, this role should better reflect their share in the global GDP.

Changes in the world economic landscape and in the new role played by countries like China, India and Brazil give the opportunity for strengthening global development policies. The rising economic strength of these countries means taking up more responsibilities in opening up their markets to the least developed countries, for example, through preferential schemes, but also on a non-discriminatory basis towards the rest of the WTO membership.</literal>

  –Madam President, I gave my vote to this report because I believe that in today’s socially and economically accelerating world order, the strengthening of our positive relations with the BRIC countries is a fundamental interest of the European Union, and therefore also of Hungary.

The need to reinforce these relations is well supported by the fact that the growth potential of these countries is becoming more and more influential on a global scale and, as a result, they are claiming an increasingly great role in shaping world politics. This rapid development influences the economic and political interests of the European Union and its Member States in every respect. The situation, naturally, has a direct impact on the economic and foreign and security policy of the EU, and in this regard, I am thinking primarily of Chinese investments.

I therefore believe that the European Union should assume a proactive role in its contact with the BRIC countries, thereby strengthening its global position.</literal>

Of course they have all kinds of things in common economically. Having lived in a BRICS country and worked in a situation where you can get things done quickly without the chains and encumbrances of red tape, I can only say that economically, they are going to go places quickly.

However, politically, we have not shown here in the European Union that we have the sophistication in foreign policy terms to develop and deal with these very varying political states in a sensible and sophisticated way. That is what we should be concentrating on and, if we cannot do that, we should leave it to Member States who can.</literal>

As Pink Floyd might have said, we should not treat them as another BRIC in the wall.

What we should be looking at is the granularity, and the differences between individual countries. So, for example, Brazil offers great prospects for many companies across the EU. The same goes for Russia, but the problem is, as Kasparov said, when it comes to elections, you already know the result, but you do not know what the outcome might be. India is the world’s largest democracy, with over a billion people and the rule of law, but not actually enough economic liberalisation. And when we look at China, there has been the economic liberalisation but not enough freedom and human rights.

All these things can only be enhanced with greater trade from the EU, but it is time that we started to try to match the growth of the BRICS countries rather than bring in policies such as the financial transaction tax, which would actually reduce growth in the EU in these difficult times.</literal>

This report puts forward what seem to be balanced recommendations to the Council for when the EU needs to place sanctions on these regimes. It is important, however, that the EU should develop clearer definitions of what sanctions criteria are, which should also be in line with the EU’s strategy on human rights. It is equally necessary to gain support for the EU sanctions policy from all of our international partners when they have been applied to third countries, which would only strengthen the impact of the policy globally. Clearly, the use of sanctions needs to be coupled with diplomacy, which is often the preferred method of responding to authoritarian regimes by the majority of our Member States and should be respected as the preferred collective tool.</literal>

  – Madam President, people often do not realise the extent to which the European Union aggressively exports its ideology. Just as the US did after the Second World War, and just as the Soviet Union did during the revolutionary period, so the European Union attempts to encourage other parts of the world to form regional blocs in mimicry of its own structures. It does not just make its aid dependent on reproductive rights and so on, but it very often – and far more damagingly – requires countries to be part of whatever regional bloc is nearby. It makes clear that it will not sign trade or aid deals with individual sovereign states but will only deal bloc to bloc.

People often do not realise the extent to which organisations like Mercosur, the Central American Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Union, are not just bodies encouraged by the European Union, but were really creatures of the EU, sponsored by the Commission and largely dependent on it for their financing. This creates a beautifully circular argument for European federalists who say, ‘We have to be part of this big bloc because that is what the rest of the world is doing’, when, of course, they are obliging the rest of the world to do so. In reality, it is the little countries that are doing well. The wealthiest countries of the world are the Monacos and the UAEs. In the top ten, only one state has a population of 7 million. It is by being this large, elephantine presence that we have made ourselves poorer and less relevant.</literal>

Most recently, the measures agreed by the EU in denying Iran some of its oil revenues are making it harder for the leadership to move money around the world, as a result of its non-cooperation with mandates and orders from the IAEA and the UN to conform with its international obligations over its nuclear programme, and this will now put much more pressure on Tehran to come back to the negotiating table.

I therefore welcome the Watson report and especially its recommendations for developing a consistent and coherent sanctions policy in the Council of Ministers, and its emphasis on the importance of acquiring wider international support such as the UN for EU sanctions to give them even further punch and effect in future.</literal>

In addition, the European Union should speak with one voice in order to achieve even greater efficiency in restrictive measures, something I believe to be particularly important.

So far, so good – I might say. What constantly disturbs me, however, is the fact that when specific changes occur in such regimes, when revolution breaks out, when people try to take their human rights into their own hands, then it seems to me that the European Union is never sufficiently prepared. I would therefore simply ask that we should work together – together with the Commission – in a strategic way, so that we have a better idea what is going on in these countries, enabling us to apply sanctions exactly where they will have an effect.</literal>

The reinforcement of the single market is in our common interest, as all Member States have a stake in the European Union’s truly becoming a free area without restrictions. By extending the interpretation of the freedom of establishment to enterprises, the investments and economic establishments of the Hungarian economy will, as part of the internal market, also benefit from full protection and security. It is the so far very successful dismantling of barriers that is the source of the global competitiveness of the EU and its individual Member States.

However, there is a real lack of consistency in legislation on transfers and on procedures for transferring registered offices, real head offices, existing companies or firms incorporated under national law from one Member State to another.

It also looks at how EU funds are used and managed by partner organisations such as the NGOs and UN agencies, and places greater emphasis on measuring results against initial indicators when the evaluations are taking place.

The report also proposes various improvements that could be made to the framework partnership agreements, notably with the process of selecting partners to try to ensure that we achieve best value for money in addition to gaining the experience and expertise that they can offer.

  – Madam President, in the European Parliament in Strasbourg recently, I met a very clever man from Nigeria called Thompson Ayodele. He talked me through a number of statistics on foreign aid, and the figures were pitilessly clear. He showed that international assistance was not useless; it was actively harmful. If you compared countries in receipt of it with countries not in receipt of it over the same periods, the countries not in receipt grew faster, were more democratic, developed more impressively, and for the obvious reason: foreign aid breaks the link between taxation, representation and expenditure. It allows governments to remain in office without the support of their populations.

There are lots of things we could be doing to help developing countries. We could open our markets; we could abolish the common agricultural policy; we could encourage their exporters to sell. But the one thing that is absolutely not going to help is giving this kind of assistance, especially when we do not have the money. This is the crazy thing!

I can understand this. It is the duty of the European Union to help people in need. Nonetheless, we must be equally clear on the other side: when assistance is given, we need to know what it is being given for and it must be easy to check whether the aid reaches its intended destination, rather than ending up in the coffers of some corrupt governments, never to be heard of again. Although this is self-evident, we nonetheless need to demand this on a daily basis. Naturally, this also means looking to ensure that the aid is genuinely efficient. We need to check that the aid really gets to where it is needed and that it is efficient. If we can manage these two things, then we shall make a lot more progress. Transparency is a minimum requirement in all of this. For this reason, I have voted in favour of this report.</literal>

  – Madam President, I have to ask the question whether this is really working, and working in a way in which it was supposed to be in the first instance. One of the greatest problems I have found in talking to people on the ground is the lack of continuity. By the time they get a programme into existence, the European Union changes its mind and goes on and creates another programme which they have to go through all the bureaucracy and red tape to qualify for again.

I think we have got to get it right. I think it has the chance and it can deliver and do good. But there is too much bureaucracy, there is too much red tape, there is too much control, and people are not allowed to get on with doing the work themselves on the ground. I personally had a recent experience in Uganda where I went out with a local faith-based organisation who are drilling one new well every week, bringing water to miles around and doing a fantastic job. Those are the type of things we should be doing, when you see the disease and the way in which disease is being reduced in children, allowing them to live and giving them life.</literal>

  –Madam President, today we are debating a report concerning the budgetary control of humanitarian aid. It is a very disturbing report.

First of all, we have the role of the United Nations. The report contends that the control of EU funds awarded to the UN is absolutely terrible. Reports to the EU are vague and late. The Court of Auditors is obstructed when it comes to accessing information about projects carried out and there is a lack of transparency, efficiency and effectiveness when it comes to the management of resources. Reforms that had been required in the past have simply not been implemented.

Next, we have cost efficiency when it comes to aid in general. From my own investigations, I know that fraud does take place in EU development projects. Thanks to OLAF and the Court of Auditors, cases are brought to light. I am focused on the fact that much more needs to be done and I will fight hard, on behalf of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), to ensure that that happens.

It is unconscionable that, despite all these serious cases, it is still being proposed that the development budget should be increased. We will therefore definitely be voting against this report.</literal>

  –Madam President, I for one agree with the endeavour to improve the effectiveness, speed and coordination of instruments at the EU’s disposal for responding to disasters. Being the world’s largest donor, the EU has an immense responsibility as a global actor in humanitarian aid throughout the world.

Since the use of these funds is managed and directed by the Commission’s Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO), I also welcome the rapporteur’s proposals for the improvement of the efficiency of the ECHO control, monitoring and supervision system. I find rapid response to natural disasters to be indispensable, as was demonstrated in the case of the 2010 disasters in Haiti and Pakistan. Both the European Union and Hungary performed well in this respect, and I therefore gave my support to this submission.</literal>

  –Madam President, it is very important that we should be having this debate on humanitarian aid. Obviously, as welfare societies, we Europeans want to support undeveloped countries, so that people there can lead a happy and full life. It is very important, however, to ensure that, when, as Europeans, we act, we implement projects which reflect European Union values and which are, in that way, ethically sustainable. Above all, we need to export democracy, human rights and freedom of expression, and make sure that Europe’s heritage of values and intellectual input are strongly present. That is why it is good to be having this debate.

I voted in favour of this report, but we still have more to do in this area, because there are several examples of these ethical principles not having been implemented in all respects everywhere as far as our EU projects are concerned.</literal>

  – Madam President, I was interested to read this report and pleased to see that it did pick up, albeit in a rather desultory way in the end, the issue of whether humanitarian aid and assistance has negative effects. I think that is the discussion that we should have in much more depth here in the Parliament because we tend to think it is a good thing per se. I happen to agree with overseas aid. I think that properly targeted and carefully monitored, it can achieve great things.

However, I was particularly struck when listening to the rapporteur this morning talking about his misgivings about our working with the UN. This really was a disturbing part of the report and, if we cannot get that right, then we should seriously consider suspending some of those programmes until we are clear that they are acting in the best interest of the people that we are trying to help.</literal>

At the recent summit, we had declaration after declaration about the need to create jobs, to reduce unemployment. And yet almost every measure that comes out of the European Union, on maternity and paternity leave, on limited working times, on the 48-hour week, on all the health and safety stuff, has precisely the opposite effect. There is this extraordinary gap between our proclaimed intention and everything that we are doing in reality.

The truth is we MEPs do not have the capacity to create jobs. We are, if you like, recipients of the largesse of the private sector which does create the jobs. But we do have the capacity to destroy jobs and we have been doing that by these intrusive regulations. The one thing we could do is to get out of the way so that entrepreneurs can make things, buy things, sell things and create employment for other people. In a variation of Hippocrates’ wisdom, we should first do no harm.</literal>

The other thing for certain is that we are still waiting on some real results actually coming from any of these Council meetings. All the time these results are not coming forward, the uncertainty continues to grow in countries within the eurozone, and that is affecting everybody else, both within and without the eurozone.

To be very honest, I can see no clear certainty how they are going to be able in any way to amend or bring things around as far as the constitution is concerned. It is by no means certain, even if they agree on a constitution, that it will ever be approved. I think this is a great weakness.

So what we need in the future is real decisions and we must not go back to the nationalistic tendencies that we witnessed in this Chamber yesterday. I hope I never see that again because that is the one thing that should not happen. We should be acting in a positive way to resolve the problem, not in a negative way.</literal>

In my view, Parliament could have also said that, in fact, the entire summit was pointless, in the same way as many other recent summits. These meetings should be prepared for adequately and should not be a sideshow put on by some of the big Member States and their leaders. Instead, they should be prepared for so that they produce results that countries commit to and press ahead with. Now France has said that they will only attend to this after the elections. This cannot be acceptable.

I would also like there to have been greater focus on growth and employment in Parliament’s statement, and especially at the summit. Furthermore, it should have contained a quite definite proposal to ban tax havens.

Therefore, we viewed this latest summit as a test of that resolve. We were sadly disappointed. The question now being asked across the United Kingdom is what happened to the veto, what happened to the stand of principle to not allow EU institutions to police the fiscal compact?

This agreement represents a new precedent within the EU. One where, if 10, 15, 20 or 25 Member States cannot find agreement across all Member States, they simply go ahead and are allowed to use the mechanisms of the EU. This was what was vetoed in December, yet this was accepted in January.

The first is that some of the weaker countries leave the eurozone and you have a stronger eurozone left behind, a sort of tougher euro which the markets recognise is too tough for them to break.

The alternative is that you accept that you have to have a fiscal union – the FU – with transfers from the richer countries to the poorer countries, led by Germany and those who want to see the eurozone not as an economic project but as a building block towards a political project, as a building block towards a United States of Europe or a federal Europe. If that is what they want, they have to be prepared to pay. It is time for Germany to put up or shut up.

  –Madam President, Iran’s nuclear programme is a real threat not just to Iran’s neighbours, but also to the whole world. Iran is a country in which no democratic standards of any kind are upheld, a country where all the values in which we in the European Union believe are persecuted or where such values are simply not found. It is a regime which is very oppressive towards its own people. We all remember the events of not long ago on the streets of Tehran. In the hands of such people, a nuclear weapon, and the Iranian nuclear programme, which will, without doubt, lead to the construction of a nuclear weapon, are extremely dangerous things.

I think the European Union has done the right thing in imposing sanctions on Iran. These sanctions are justified and we are acting here in a good cause. I am very pleased that the European Union has taken such action. I also want to appeal yet again in this Chamber for the European Union to show solidarity with our greatest ally in the Middle East, and to do so, too, as part of this discussion about the Iranian nuclear programme. By this I mean Israel, a country which holds the same values in which we also believe.</literal>

With a lack of cooperation with international bodies, I have a number of concerns about this nuclear programme and its possible intentions. It is therefore, sadly, a necessary step to prohibit the importation of crude oil from Iran, twinned with imposing a number of other financial measures against the Central Bank of Iran. The sanctions proposed are therefore, in my opinion, a proportionate and reasonable response by the EU at the request of its Member States.</literal>

  – Madam President, I was unusual among British Conservatives in opposing the Iraq war and indeed in opposing the prolongation and permanence of the mission in Afghanistan, although I had supported limited action against the Taliban regime.

One of the reasons I was worried about the Western mission was that it seemed to me strategically erroneous to remove from both of Iran’s flanks what had, up until then, been powers which had been anti-Tehran and anti-Ayatollah and had contained a regime which has given ample evidence of its readiness to strike anywhere in the world. It sponsors militias and terrorist organisations in Central Asia, in the Balkans; it struck even as far afield as London and Buenos Aires.

There is an argument that we got the whole thing wrong, that we should have had nothing to do with Iran, that we should have just stayed out of the way. But we are now in a situation where we have embarked on action and, as Polonius says, ‘Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, bear’t that the opposed may beware of thee’. This is, I think, the most important foreign policy issue of our age and it will take extraordinary resolve to see it through safely.</literal>

Its military aspect may have significant security implications, with not just a regional, but also a global impact. This is why efforts must be stepped up to find a solution which combines tough measures with proposals for dialogue. At the same time, the impact of the sanctions must be constantly assessed to ascertain their effectiveness. In light of this, I should mention how important it is to coordinate our actions with those of the other global actors in order to achieve tangible results. Turkey can play a positive role in the efforts to resolve the Iran dossier. I hope that cooperation will be enhanced in this area with Ankara.

My group, including myself, views these sanctions with caution, because we fear that they will strengthen Iran’s administration and therefore defeat their own purpose. After all, Iran’s leaders need some sort of enemy to be, and to look, strong, and I am afraid that now, as a consequence, we have fallen into this trap. However, now we still have to negotiate and discuss matters, although we know that Iran is not an easy negotiating partner, nor can it be trusted.

Sometimes, it is also worth putting yourself in the position of the opposite party. Iran is the former Persia, a country proud of its history, and one that regards itself as a civilised nation, which, in the light of history, it is. My fear is that sanctions will make the Iranians feel that their pride has been injured and that things will go against what we are all hoping for: negotiations, peace and the renunciation of nuclear weapons.</literal>

It is the case that the speeches that Ahmadinejad has made both at the UN and to the world at large are so provocative that we need to respond to them. We Europeans have to stand up to this and be frank and clear. We also have to support the sole democracy in the Middle East, Israel, which is especially under threat from Iran now, as we know from what Ahmadinejad has said about threatening to wipe Israel off the map of the world.

However, it is not just Israel, as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East, that is under threat: it is also all of Europe and the Western world, the free world, the democratic world. That is why we have to act robustly and firmly to ensure that Iran is prepared to abandon its programme.

  – Madam President, firstly, we must say that these new sanctions are not aimed at the Iranian people who have been suffering long and hard under an authoritarian regime. Secondly, it is not our remit to prohibit any country from developing nuclear energy if it so wishes.

But, of course, in Iran, all the evidence suggests that the intent goes far beyond nuclear energy and has a military dimension. This has been borne out by six resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations, of which Iran is a member; all have been ignored. So, like Mr Kamall said a minute ago in relation to another topic, it is time for us to put up or shut up, and putting-up means imposing sanctions with the hope that Iran will desist from its present course and return to the negotiating table.</literal>

Let me bring to your attention a curious incident in connection with this report: recently, the national ice hockey teams of Romania and Hungary played each other in Miercurea Ciuc, a Romanian city with a Hungarian majority. Since all but two players on the Romanian national ice hockey team belong to the Hungarian minority community of Romania, these players, too, sang the Hungarian national anthem at the customary singing of anthems before the game. The incident received special attention from the Romanian central press, and many accused the ice hockey players of Hungarian nationality who make up almost the entire Romanian national team of treason.

It would be high time for mutual respect and tolerance to permeate not only the atmosphere of sports events but also public statements, as in this case it was not the gestures of the fans but the malicious and manipulative activities of Romanian politicians and the Romanian press that incited intolerance. Romania won the game

4-1, by the way.</literal>

This weekend sees the start of the Six Nations Championship, where Wales will proudly play their national sport. As an avid rugby supporter, I cannot help but see this as a missed opportunity for the Parliament. The report should have focused on the positive contribution that sports can have on both participants and supporters in terms of instilling values of respect, fair play and social inclusion, and should have focused on how the EU could help the development of grassroot sports. It instead concentrates on how the EU can take advantage of the increasing popularity of professional sport, including how to develop a database to share information on hooligans, which effectively duplicates the work already being conducted by Europol. The report proposes that all agents representing European sportsmen have their fiscal residence in the EU. This clearly does not serve to promote sport across the EU and certainly not globally.

Today’s vote was undemocratic, however, when smaller groups requested roll-call votes. It is because they need to register disappointment on certain parts of reports. Today, sadly, that was denied by the President.</literal>

In my opinion, the report focuses far too much on the commercial side of sport. Instead, the development of grassroots in sport is overlooked in favour of developing means to take further advantage of the popularity of professional sport.

Instead of, for instance, creating a new EU database of football hooligans, which is already a Europol competence, we should focus on national authorities developing sports facilities at the more local level, with the aim that hooliganism can be diminished thanks to greater Community involvement and the ability to get along with others or work as part of team. We should focus on skills; participation in sport has been proven to be a way of teaching these skills. We should be giving more people the chance to learn a sense of discipline and self-worth rather than focusing exclusively on introducing new EU legal rules on fiscal residence for sports agents, as the report seems to suggest.</literal>

Similarly, it is unacceptable that young girls are prohibited, for example, from being able to take up some disciplines, as we know, due to religious strictures imposed by their parents. The rapporteur has done well to highlight this point, since sport must be free to affirm universal values and Europe cannot tolerate these practices out of false religious do-goodism.

Moreover, I believe it is right to preserve and rediscover local, traditional and indigenous sports. In Tuscany, we inare fighting in this regard to protect a historic form of football played in Florentine costume and to rediscover the ancient game of football () in Prato.

  –Madam President, I would like to say that I voted in favour of this report by Mr Fisas Ayxela. We must remember that it is the first more extensive report on sport, and sport, of course, is the biggest popular movement in the whole of the European Union.

This is a first step, and I am therefore slightly disappointed that the friends of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group there on the right see only a threat and not opportunities. Perhaps you might reconsider this for a moment: this will provide great opportunities for taking sport forward, improving public health, increasing well-being at European Union level, and more.

Trivial matters like the flag, whether or not it is on the inside or outside of the team shirt (which is completely optional), or whether the EU flag should or should not be raised at a particular sporting event, are neither here nor there. Moreover, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland can play under their own flags, and no one will say anything about it. On the contrary, the aim is for civic commitment on the part of Europeans at grassroots level: for people for whom sport is important. We are also trying get people involved in building their own nation, as a priority, but it is also seen as a common benefit in the European internal market if we have healthy employees.</literal>

  – Madam President, as the Chairman of the European Parliament’s Friends of Sport group, I took a particular interest in this report, as did many other members of that group and the relevant committees. It is interesting that we wanted in our group to vote against the display of the EU flag on national sports jerseys. Surely it is important that we allow supporters to decide that they can support their own country?

But I think what is more important than anything else is actually what sport teaches us. Sport is all about fair play. Sport is all about adhering to the rules. As my old school song used to say, it is all about tasting the sweet of victory and the salt of defeat. At the European level, there have been moves towards more fair play. UEFA, the football organisation, has a UEFA fair play award.

But when it came to democracy in this Chamber today, the rules were thrown out. The spirit of fair play was completely ignored by the President of the Parliament. Had there been a fair-play award for democracy, Schulz would not have got it.</literal>

  –Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing is clear from the numerous waste-related petitions received by Parliament from citizens: EU management of waste in Europe is not going well.

There are too many citizens who even now, in 2012, are paying for the consequences of poor waste management in terms of their daily lives and their health, incinerators and landfills being cases in point. All the same, virtuous examples of ecologically sustainable waste management in the EU do exist. We must therefore do all we can to reach a point of total recycling, where waste actually becomes a genuine resource.

This is already a reality today. There are treatment plants that recycle nearly 100% of urban waste, as in the case of the Vedelago waste centre in the province of Treviso, whose technology is exported throughout Europe. Nevertheless, we need more controls, prevention and, above all, responsible choices. We should recycle, recover and reduce waste and say ‘no’ to huge incinerators and landfills that are often the cause of air and aquifer pollution.</literal>

It has become clear that the management of waste disposal is posing a political and social problem in many Member States and the European Commission has a fundamental role in controlling and guiding them to ensure the proper enforcement of the EU wasteat national level and raise greater environmental awareness among citizens. This is the right time to stop saying waste is an issue and turn it into an opportunity for job and business creation, because efficient waste management strategies can provide enormous opportunities for both employment creation and revenue enhancement while ensuring environmental sustainability.</literal>

  – Madam President, it is a report that highlights the fact that, despite the directive being adopted, many times we have actually seen huge numbers of breaches across different Member States. It is certainly true that it has not been uniformly implemented across the 27 Member States.

This is reinforced by the sheer number of petitions and letters received by the Parliament, where EU citizens, including a number of my Welsh constituents, have also directly expressed their concern about potential breaches of a number of such EU directives. It is time that we use all technology available to us and see this as a huge way of being able to embrace technology and deal with our waste effectively.

I voted in favour of this report today in order that we can move things on. Implementation of existing rules is all well and good, but we also need to embrace that technology to move things forward.</literal>

The European Parliament receives many petitions, including from the United Kingdom, concerning issues of waste management and the infringement of the EU directives that govern it. It is evident from this fact that in many Member States, directives are not being transposed or enforced in a satisfactory way.

We agree with the conclusions of the report that all illegal landfills should be closed, secured and rehabilitated. We also agree that guidance should be given as to the location of the landfill sites with relation to local housing, schools and health facilities and that there should be better inspections and more consultation when waste facilities are in their planning stages.

Furthermore, I agree, particularly now that there is clean, high-temperature incineration technology available, that it is preferable to burn waste rather than placing it in landfill sites, especially given the increasing proportion of our waste that is now being recycled and, as I said, the technological improvements which are now being developed in this area.</literal>

As a member of the Committee on Petitions, I have often participated in debates on this topic. I should point out that the new Member States are at the bottom of the league when it comes to recycling, even though the volume of waste they produce is below the European average. Romania is among the countries targeted by petitions about waste management. In order to meet EU standards, my country is currently implementing the integrated waste management system. It will result in the closure of landfills that are not environmentally friendly and in the development of sorting stations for recyclable waste by 2015. Current landfills pose an increased risk both to the environment and to the communities living in their vicinity.</literal>

I will not get involved in the detail, but there are very few people who have not had some experience of it.

We should also make it clear that we cannot allow local and public authorities to get away with not stipulating standards and not bringing sites to the same standards as others. I have seen some of these sites where a lot of leaching was taking place and I believe better solutions can, should and must be found where necessary. This must end.

Instead, we have had too many countries that would not even apply the directive leading, as Kay Swinburne said, to many petitions coming here.

I led one myself and I am pleased to say that, as a result of the decision here and the direction given by the Committee on Petitions, EUR 40 million has now been committed to closing a toxic site in my constituency, Haulbowline, which was leading to an increase in cancer 37% higher than the national average.

The call on the Commission to work with those Member States whose participation in the programme so far has been weak, in the hope that all Member States will be at a similarly reasonably high level in terms of their involvement, is also one we support.

We should also support the move for the programme to focus more of its attention on the eradication of so-called – and rather shocking – honour killings and female genital mutilation, which sadly still goes on in some Member States and should have absolutely no place whatsoever in a European society.</literal>

In my own constituency of Northern Ireland, figures show that domestic violence accounts for approximately one third of all crime, with the police service attending an average of 60 domestic-related incidents per day, with a large amount still going unreported. The Daphne programme and others like it can play a pivotal role in the fight against domestic violence and abuse.

In Northern Ireland, there are many excellent programmes carried out at local level with outstanding work being done by local community groups across my constituency. I believe that such organisations are the key to combating issues of violence and abuse, as they are best placed to cater for the individual needs of citizens in their region. Simpler and easier access to funding is essential and should be a feature of any new provision.</literal>

As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I believe that the report is correct in stating that children should already be informed about the dangers of online content while at school. On the other hand, education could also facilitate the reduction of gender inequality at a young age.

The attention of young people should be drawn to the prevention of deviant behaviour through anti-violence campaigns, and I would therefore like to stress the issue highlighted by the report, namely, that the Commission’s rights and citizenship programme for 2014-2020 does not mention combating violence against children, young people and women among its specific objectives.

  –Madam President, I voted in favour of the report due to the enormous need for diversification of energy sources in Europe. Until recently, the construction of the Northern Gas Pipeline – from Russia to Germany – was intended to be the panacea for all energy shortages. The pipeline was supposed to secure a steady delivery of natural gas to the European Union. As recently as yesterday, the Russian company, Gazprom, reduced gas delivery to a number of European Union states. According to the company, the decision resulted from the increase in demand for natural gas in Russia, which occurred as a consequence of the freezing conditions. A few years ago, political point scoring in Russia led to other countries suffering from a shortage of natural gas. This illustrates the importance of the pursuit of new energy sources within the European Union, both in the context of the European Union’s security as well as in terms of the protection of all types of EU activity. It is, of course, not possible for the EU to attain self-sufficiency in this area, but it is necessary to use all possible means to achieve security. Thank you very much.</literal>

Firstly, the State aid policy following the banking crisis, secondly the reform of the Fining Guidelines in anti-trust law, and, thirdly, competition in the energy sector.

I would like mainly to deal with the second issue, namely, the reform of the Fining Guidelines.

Nonetheless, we, the European Parliament, believe that there is an urgent need to clarify the 1/2003 Guidelines so that it will be easier to predict in future the penalties a business can expect if it does not adequately comply with these legal regulations.

Secondly, we wish urgently to call on the Commission finally to introduce a special regime for small and medium-sized enterprises, so-called mono-product undertakings, as otherwise, difficulties will arise here and comparisons with other undertakings will not be possible.

Sometimes, it is a bit of a struggle to give any coherent answer, depending on what the news of the day happens to be. It is particularly difficult in the context of representing a Member State which is high up on the list of net contributors to the European budget.

So I was delighted to be able to support this report, which really deals with a subject where I am always consistently able to point at something that the European Union has done for us. EU competition policy is one area where I can be truly enthusiastic. It has provided that essential tool, eliminating the obstacles that Mr Tannock spoke about. I am particularly keen to see that the rapporteur has recognised the need to update rules. Constant update to processes is vitally important to maintain consumer confidence in what we are doing.</literal>

It is in the EU’s interest to promote coordination with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and other emerging powers, owing to the growing global importance of these countries in various areas. Just as there is already continuous coordination between them, the EU should, for example, promote harmonious positions for meetings such as the United Nations General Assembly or strategic partnerships in other areas, provided that this does not jeopardise the interests of the EU Member States and their citizens. As such, it is appropriate to build these diplomatic efforts through an institutional mechanism, perhaps through the European External Action Service, which can deal with these countries in a consistent and even way.</literal>

I agree with the rapporteur that the overall coordination of EU foreign policy towards the BRICS and other emerging powers should be ensured by the Commission, that better linking of foreign and security policy with EU sectoral policies should be implemented by the following actions: increasing the participation of the EP in bilateral summits between the EU and its strategic partners, increasing the role of the BRICS in international development policy that better reflects their share in global GDP, strengthening the strategic dialogue between EU and USA on global governance and reform of international organisations. We, Members of European Parliament, conclude that the EU should take into account the new weight in political and economic terms of the BRICS and other emerging powers and use its political leverage to continue promoting universal values in the looming new multipolar system of global governance and be at the forefront of the process of reform of the international governance system.</literal>

In this renewed world asset, the EU must be at the forefront of the reform of the international system and must use its political leverage to continue to promote universal values. To lead this process, the EU needs to act as a single and robust political and economic entity.

In addition to that, there will be also the potential risk of political and economic fragmentation, and of competing world agendas. With this report indeed, we ask for a strategic partnership with each BRICS country as a means of advancing peace and global security, the promotion of human rights, democracy, sustainable development and global financial regulation.</literal>

I voted in favour of this text because it will allow us to go beyond cooperation in purely economic terms and to strive for the creation of a common foreign policy platform. These countries want us, the western powers, to include them more with a view to strengthening global governance and multilateral diplomacy. Let us not forget that the BRICS countries are already showing clear ambitions in foreign policy terms, as they have held regular meetings since 2009 and are seeking to establish common positions. For the time being, they are doing this without us. It is therefore imperative that we take into account the new economic and political weight of the BRICS countries. As the rapporteur emphasises, ‘this proves all the more necessary, considering that transnational challenges – such as climate change, global regulatory issues, access to raw materials and rare earths, terrorism, sustainable development,’ etc. – will require an inclusive approach based on common values. Thanks to this report, the European Union is taking the initiative and declaring that it wants to play a key role.</literal>

Ever increasing demographic imbalances between Western countries and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and other emerging powers in the near future threaten to change the hitherto established relationship of influence in the international arena and the system of global governance itself. In 2050, seven emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey) are projected to have larger economies than all the Group of Seven (G7) countries (USA, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy) put together. China is projected to become the world’s largest economy by 2020, while India could become the fastest growing economy in the world by 2050. These countries will become increasingly important internationally, particularly for tackling global issues such as combating climate change, international terrorism, the distribution of resources and rare minerals, political stability worldwide, etc. Therefore, the EU must enhance cooperation with the BRICS and other emerging powers in the system of global governance and in international organisations.

Faced, for example, with the prediction that China will soon become the world’s largest economy, Brussels must increase its efforts to influence the emerging multipolar system of global governance effectively. One of the objectives of the Union’s foreign policy is the adoption of a coherent approach towards these countries when viewed as a potential bloc, and the widening of cooperation and strategic partnerships with each of these countries individually, especially with those that are democratic, for such a partnership will constitute an ideal tool with real potential for introducing change. In an increasingly coherent manner, the BRICS countries are also deciding the political direction of prominent international organisations, such as the United Nations. Moreover, taking into account the economic as well as the demographic potential of these countries, only a coordinated European policy can contribute to the increased role and effectiveness of the Union on the international arena.

According to current data, it is projected that the economic growth of the BRICS will only increase in future, and that by 2050, their economic growth will exceed that of all the G7 countries (USA, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy) put together.

Should the economic growth of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and the emerging economies be further consolidated, these countries will acquire strong relevance in foreign policy terms on the global scene. However, considering the interdependence between the world’s economies, the consolidation of the economic leadership of the emerging economies will be conditional on the welfare of the emerged economies.

I support the G20 parliamentary dimension and I believe that it should be further consolidated and involved in decision-making processes, in order to ensure reinforced democratic dialogue and greater scrutiny. I firmly believe that the current sovereign debt crisis will be an important test for the G20 as an effective forum for strategic political dialogue, creating foundations for the elimination of systemic unbalances which can be particularly damaging both for developed economies and, in a longer-term perspective, emerging ones, and promoting solidarity in international financial fora such as the International Monetary Fund. The EU must enhance political dialogue and cooperation with the BRIC countries in order to push further forward the reform of global financial and economic governance institutions, that is to say, the Bretton Woods institutions, with the aim of ensuring the broader representation of all member countries while reflecting changes in economic weight.</literal>

               –The BRICS countries have enjoyed significant economic growth in recent years, which, against the backdrop of the crisis, has brought about changes in terms of the global balance of influence. However, these countries, apart from Russia, are still developing countries which have the biggest concentration of poverty in the world.

There is the risk that this accelerated economic growth will deepen the inequalities in spite of the considerable progress made, particularly in the case of Brazil. According to estimates, China will become the biggest economy in the world before 2020, while the economies of the main seven emerging countries will be more powerful than those of the G7 countries in 2050.

With their political role increasing commensurately with their economic clout, the main BRICS countries are also assuming ever growing responsibility for driving global social progress and for international development policy. I hope that common concerns about complementing ‘aid effectiveness’ with ‘development effectiveness’ will provide a common platform for increasing the involvement of the emerging countries in development policies.</literal>

The concern being expressed is, however, that they should be considered separately. There are a number of reasons for this. The growth and diversification of the BRIC countries’ economic activity jeopardises the traditional division of global labour, which is unfavourable to these countries. Their role is not limited to producing items low in value added and exporting raw materials and agricultural produce for countries at the heart of the capitalist system. Today, they are increasingly becoming world powers to rival the triad: the US, Japan and the EU. Some of them are even pursuing the opposite path to the EU in the fight against hunger and poverty. We should not forget that in a few years, millions of people have been pulled out of extreme poverty in China, India and Brazil, in a process that has not been without major contradictions. It is a fact that, internationally, the BRIC countries have been coming together on a number of important issues. The positions taken up by the BRIC countries in the international arena and their working together are increasingly being seen as a threat to the influence and dominance of the aforementioned triad, especially in the institutions of international capitalism: the World Bank, the IMF and the G20.</literal>

               –The growing political and economic importance of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS group) increases the importance of these countries in terms of foreign policy. In terms of the global economy, it is also expected that the economies of seven rapidly developing countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey) will be bigger in 2050 than the economies of the G7 countries (USA, Japan, Canada, UK, Germany, France and Italy) put together. With regard to gross domestic product, it is assumed that China will become the largest economy in the world before 2020 and that India could become the fastest growing economy in the world before 2050.

I firmly believe that it would be appropriate to try to achieve something more than mutual trust, recognition and cooperation, and to make efforts to create a common platform on foreign policy issues based on the assumption that a new system of global governance is being established that will be sufficiently accessible to the BRICS group and other emerging powers and founded on common values.​ The current trade agreements between the EU and the BRICS group of countries are not only mutually beneficial in economic terms, but are also politically beneficial for both parties.

               – This week, the Parliament has been discussing the EU's relations towards the BRICS and other emerging powers. Good relations with countries like Brazil are vital, especially in terms of encouraging trade. One key area of interest to me is the trade of agricultural products. We import large amounts of meat from Brazil; meat that comes from animals that do not have to comply with the same rigorous standards and regulation that our farmers are subjected to. One example is the introduction of yet another pointless and costly regulation to electronically identify all sheep within the EU. These new rules to monitor the movement of sheep are flawed. They require a 100% accuracy rate of recording to be achieved by farmers, a task which is impossible because the available technology is not 100% reliable. If our farmers fail to achieve a 100% accuracy rate, they face heavy financial penalties. This is completely unacceptable. I therefore urge the Commission to review this regulation to allow some discretion to reflect the reality of the unreliable EID technology.</literal>

With this in mind, we are proposing to give a few more powers to these emerging countries in the UN and the IMF, since we are begging them for a bail-out in the euro crisis. It would also mean exclusively entrusting relations with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to the European Union, so, for the moment, to Baroness Ashton, while national diplomacies would be mere relays with no autonomy from the decisions taken in Brussels.

               –The crisis that is raging in Europe does not instil optimism. Instead of abating, the recession is deepening, unemployment is growing, and the lack of innovation and new investment in Europe do not suggest that the situation will improve. As it falls into a state of apathy, Europe is no longer a model to emulate, in contrast to the accelerating economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS group of countries), which are relatively unaffected by the global recession. According to economic forecasts, the economies of these countries are predicted to accelerate even further. In addition, these countries are strengthening politically and developing common positions – which are often controversial for Europe – in relation to global conflicts and problems.

Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur that the Union should cooperate closely with these countries, but that this cooperation should not come at any price. We should bear in mind the unquestionable potential of these countries, but we should not undervalue our own economy and its capabilities. This is a difficult challenge, since taking into account the unequal conditions of competition, manifested by cheap labour achieved at the cost of human rights, as well as lower production standards, or quite simply, superior natural conditions and access to natural resources, Europe will face a difficult task. We cannot, however, succumb entirely to economic pressures and forget about fundamental European values.</literal>

               –As the current economic crisis demonstrates, there is a strong degree of interdependence between emerged powers and emerging powers. We support this report, since its aim is to discuss the foundations of a new, inclusive system of global governance and since it attempts to make recommendations, whilst identifying key areas of reform, where the EU could seek to streamline its action and institutional architecture and thereby increase its potential and effectiveness as a global actor.

What is really needed is to go beyond cooperation in economic terms, and strive rather for the creation of a common platform in foreign policy terms, provided a new system of global governance, inclusive enough and based on shared values, is devised. The EU will have to duly take into account the new weight, in political and economic terms, of these countries and other emerging powers and use its political leverage to continue to promote universal values in the looming new multipolar system of global governance and be at the forefront of the process of reform of the international governance system.</literal>

In paragraph 12, the report supports a balanced and fair conclusion of the EU-Mercosur agreement. However, the Commission has indicated that such an agreement will damage the interests of EU agriculture. Indeed, the Commission is prepared to accept that damage will be done by attempting to extend the scope of the EU Globalisation Adjustment Fund to farmers.

I believe that this proposal does not make sense in light of the Treaty of Lisbon. Firstly, it concerns two quite different policies, subject to very different systems under the EU Treaties. Secondly, under the Treaty, the High Representative only has the jurisdiction to steer foreign and security policy, and not to ‘coordinate’ the various EU external action policies, in particular, foreign trade policy. Thirdly, where there is a need for such ‘coordination’, this falls to the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Trade together, without this meaning that one has any authority over the other, or that there is any hierarchy. This proposal will therefore mean an unacceptable change to the balance and distribution of powers between the institutions and bodies of the EU.</literal>

These days, international trade has become an instrument of foreign policy and if we want to create a new system of global governance, we will need to very much keep in mind the economic issues and the current position of these countries that, like China, implement an expansionist, and not always transparent, policy from the financial, commercial and economic perspective vis-à-vis industrialised and developing countries.

Europe must not let slip the opportunity to take on the major transnational challenges, from climate change to food security, by cooperating with powers projected to have larger economies than, collectively, the G7 countries. At the same time, however, it must be vigilant that market rules, free competition and mutual political recognition do not remain simply on the paper of international agreements but are also respected in those countries, such as the BRICS, where the system of values and freedoms sometimes assumes forms different from our own.

As pointed out by the rapporteur, it is estimated that in 2050, the combined relevance of the seven largest emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico) will be greater than the economic relevance of the G7 countries. The aforementioned growing economic powers have already proven that they foster high ambitions in terms of foreign policy, and it is likely that they will gradually take over leadership in the shaping of global governance and strategies of global significance. This shows how important it is to increase internal cohesion within the EU and to strengthen our common foreign policy. Only by acting as a single robust entity will we be able to compete with the growing economic and political powers and maintain relevance in the new, multipolar system of global governance and leadership. The emerging new global balance of forces creates an opportunity for the European Union to take initiative and assume leadership in the process of changing and reforming the system of global governance, which will include the new powers. We have an opportunity to create a new platform for international foreign policy based on mutual trust and common values, which will support cooperation in trade and economic terms, as well as cooperation to find more effective solutions to global issues such as climate change, global peace and security and sustainable development.</literal>

I agree with the rapporteur on the proposed clearer criteria for EU sanctions in order to enhance the consistency, transparency and credibility of their application. I also agree that an annual report should be made on the implementation of sanctions, the European Parliament should be fully and regularly associated in the review process and the evaluation of sanctions should be done in dialogue with the people and civil society organisations of the targeted countries, with the aim of developing and strengthening the respect for democracy and human rights. The EU Member States would have to declare when persons on sanctions lists have physical or financial assets within their borders, to apply financial sanctions or restrictive measures in case of any financial intervention. We, Members of European Parliament, believe that measures clearly targeted to the accountable regimes and EU coordinated action will strive to minimise the adverse impact on the civil population, in particular, the most vulnerable.</literal>

               – I voted for this resolution because the European Parliament must reiterate once again that sanctions are not an end in themselves and that decisions on sanctions by the EU should be taken only after thorough evaluation of the most efficient way to support democratic change. The EU has often applied its sanctions policy inconsistently by treating third countries with similar human rights and democratic records differently. Such behaviour has often encouraged criticism for applying double standards. With this resolution, we want to stress that sanctions should be applied regardless of political, economic and security interests. All restrictive measures must comply with international humanitarian law and with the principle of proportionality and must not penalise the most vulnerable population groups in countries affected by these measures. For these reasons, I consider the ‘targeted sanctions’ overall a better instrument. Sanctioned leaders will be affected only if they are personally subject to pressure in the form of restrictions on their ability to move money, invest and access their financial assets, restrictions for travel or for diplomatic representation.</literal>

Sanctions or restrictive measures, such as arms embargoes, trade sanctions, financial and economic sanctions, the freezing of assets, flight bans, restrictions on admission, diplomatic sanctions, boycotts of sporting and cultural events and the suspension of cooperation with third countries, can only be effective if imposed by the whole of the EU. Disagreement among Member States often leads to inconsistent application of restrictive measures, which damages the EU’s credibility and has a detrimental impact on the effectiveness of those measures. I welcome the European Parliament’s recommendations that an effective sanctions policy needs to be established throughout the EU, developing clear criteria for when sanctions are to be applied, determining clear objectives, the form of sanctions to be applied and guidelines for their evaluation, which would help improve collaboration and synergy among Member States and ensure that there are no double standards when deciding on restrictive measures or sanctions.</literal>

Quite often, these leaders are benefiting from the advantages of Western civilisation. Taking note of the fact that these leaders use their assets, which are quite often illegal, to bolster their power and oppress their own citizens, I support the recommendations included in the resolution. Strengthening the array of restrictive measures, through denying sanctioned leaders the right to perform monetary transactions within the Member States, to travel and obtain education, to provide funding to research centres and operate businesses, are just some of the instruments that we can employ.

               –EU policy towards regimes that violate the principles of democracy and freedom and the human rights of their peoples has often been strongly criticised. Indeed, there has often been, and culpably continues to be, a basic ambiguity by which the EU, while acknowledging the anti-democratic nature of many governments, has preferred to keep silent on the matter and continue to enter into political and economic ties with these countries, confining itself to inserting into various cooperation agreements clauses on the respect of human rights which many regimes clearly fail to observe. With this own-initiative report, Parliament calls on the EU to adopt stricter measures and policies towards politicians and key figures in non-democratic regimes of third countries when they exercise their personal or commercial interests within the borders of the 27 Member States. We also call attention to the need to make violations of religious freedom and freedom of expression in third countries sufficient reason for Member States and the EU as a whole to implement more than political sanctions and responses. It is further proposed that forms, means and procedures for enforcing sanctions be codified more precisely than thus far. I voted in favour of the report.</literal>

In other words, people who, by getting round the measures imposed by Europe, manage to exercise, influence and exploit personal, economic and political interests on EU territory. Better coordination is therefore desirable among Member States in applying those measures imposed at EU level; in addition, EU Member States should actively investigate and prosecute persons or legal entities in Europe that have assisted sanctioned leaders and persons associated with them in evading or avoiding the sanctions imposed against them. Lastly, clear criteria must be developed for when restrictive measures are to be applied and, at the same time, the objectives for such measures must be identified: by establishing precise rules, it is possible to enhance the consistency and credibility of EU sanctions.</literal>

Sanctions are one of the instruments of this approach. Moreover, the explicit encouragement of support for parties that are in conflict, with a view to regime change or to shifts in political power in certain countries, constitutes unacceptable interference, which invariably includes undisguised ambitions to satisfy economic and/or political interests.

However, the EU has often applied its sanctions policy inconsistently by treating third countries with similar human rights and democratic records differently, and such actions have prompted criticism for applying double standards. I therefore firmly believe that it is necessary to develop clear criteria for when restrictive measures are to be applied, the objectives for such measures, the form of sanctions to be applied, guidelines for their periodic evaluation and the review procedure to be followed in consultation with the European Parliament. We should establish the criteria in a way that enhances the consistency and credibility of EU sanctions, but leaves sufficient flexibility at the operational level, enabling the Union to leverage the instrument as an effective tool in its external action.</literal>

The EU must not remain indifferent when human rights are being violated brutally, when human life or peace is put at risk. If our values are to be properly safeguarded and if we are to be active defendants of victimised nations and national minorities, then, in some cases, it is necessary to apply restrictive measures.

               –I voted in favour of this resolution because the EU must pursue a consistent policy towards regimes against which it imposes restrictive measures. Above all, it is very important to ensure that every decision taken by the EU is duly substantiated. We also need to set out clear and precise criteria for the application of restrictive measures and establish an effective sanctions policy. Each restrictive measure and sanction must be imposed in a targeted and proportionate manner, following a thorough analysis of the structural, social and economic situation of the country concerned. It should be noted that a consistent policy towards authoritarian regimes must be pursued not just outside the EU, but also on the territory of the EU itself. The Member States have a special role to play in this respect and must ensure that restrictive measures are implemented effectively against the leaders of authoritarian regimes when they exercise their personal and commercial interests within the EU.</literal>

Equally, it must cover the assets and interests held by those political leaders within the EU. From the freezing of the assets of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, to those of the former presidents of Tunisia and Egypt, the EU must adopt proportional and equivalent restrictive measures in respect of every dictatorial regime. This is why I believe it is important to urge the Council to apply such restrictive measures whenever the need arises.</literal>

               –On the basis of an own-initiative report, on 2 February 2012, Parliament voted for a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on a consistent policy towards regimes against which the EU applies restrictive measures when their leaders exercise their personal and commercial interests within EU borders. The purpose of these measures is to prevent capital flight from such countries. It is estimated that in the last two decades, approximately USD 150 billion has left certain countries in North Africa, namely Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, as a result of the actions of authoritarian leaders and their circles of associates, while restrictive measures were already in place on the part of the European institutions. In order to achieve the desired consistency, financial sanctions or restrictive measures need to be rigorously applied to these countries by all of the Member States.</literal>

               –I agree with and support the conclusions in Mr Watson’s report. The EU is now the world’s biggest market and the largest donor of development aid. It represents a unique opportunity for promoting human rights and respect for the rules of peaceful coexistence of the community of Member States. Unfortunately, thus far, the cumbersome red tape surrounding the EU’s restrictive measures against regimes that do not respect international law, and the failure of such measures to feed into one another, have meant that they have not always had the desired effect as deterrents and sanctions. It is unjust that sometimes, peoples that are already oppressed or European companies and citizens should have suffered the consequences of sanctions, while the corrupt, violent local elites have managed to evade them. In the same way, it is equally unjust that third countries take and have taken advantage of European respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. I therefore join Mr Watson in calling for the Council to adopt, as soon as possible, clear rules – to be applied uniformly and subject to periodic review – that will enable the restrictive measures to be more effective.</literal>

               –The European Union is founded on the principle of human dignity, and its action includes support for political regimes based on citizen representation and respect for fundamental human rights. A natural corollary of this is the need to reject authoritarian regimes which, instead of pursuing the common good of the people that they represent, are predisposed to satisfy the personal interests of the holders of posts in public bodies. In this context, it is appropriate that any measures adopted by the EU clearly identify which individuals are subject to sanctions, on the one hand, and when sanctions should be applied, on the other, so that measures adopted will be targeted at the subjects to be sanctioned, in order to prevent the people of the country from being affected, wherever possible. Any guidelines established should also be adopted by all of the Member States, in order to ensure an effective foreign policy. Moreover, and this is a key point in the report, they should take advantage of the possibility that a large proportion of the personal assets of leaders subjected to the sanctions will be within EU borders, opening the door to more effective action by the EU. Since that is the argument of this recommendation, I voted in favour.</literal>

In the first place, we need to acknowledge that sanctions are not an end in themselves and when they are applied, they must be accompanied by clear and achievable benchmarks for the lifting of sanctions. Then it takes unity as regards decisions: we need to commit to maximising collaboration and synergy amongst the 27 EU Member States, urging them to speak with a unified and consistent voice on the matter of condemning authoritarian regimes through a single integrated approach. Sanctions which are not internationally coordinated can prove ineffective and counterproductive to their stated aims, can undermine the transparency, credibility and coherence of the European sanctions policy, and can reinforce the targeted regime or reduce the relative negotiation leeway and credibility of the EU and its Member States with the state in question.</literal>

The imposition of general or selective sanctions should be aimed at those responsible and should safeguard the vulnerable as far as possible. I therefore support the contents of this report, as it states that economic and financial sanctions applied to those in power and/or the natural and legal persons and/or entities concerned should also include all financial assets and property within EU borders. To this end, there is a need to set out clear criteria for applying sanctions and coordinating them among the Member States, in order to evaluate the assets of individuals who appear on the sanctions list, so that these assets may be confiscated. Moreover, I believe that it is vital that Parliament be kept informed from the beginning and throughout the process of imposing sanctions.</literal>

According to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), ‘The Union’s action on the international scene shall be guided by the principles which have inspired its own creation, development and enlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the wider world: democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law’. The regimes against which the EU applies restrictive measures, when their leaders exercise their personal and commercial interests within EU borders, are regimes that violate human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and principles of good governance. The purpose of these restrictive measures is to promote peace and security globally and the principles of Article 21 of the TEU. Furthermore, the measures implemented must not have an adverse impact on the general public, especially on the most vulnerable groups among them. I think that it is important that the EU acts in a united, coherent manner in order to make these measures more effective and enhance the EU’s credibility globally.</literal>

               –The EU must learn from its mistakes. There have been many examples – some of which are mentioned in this report – where the leaders of ruthless dictatorships have increased their wealth with the help of other EU Member States. Even more shocking is the fact that all of this went on very openly and for a long time. Gaddafi’s regime, for instance, was estimated to have assets worth billions throughout the EU, particularly private property in the United Kingdom. The fortune of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his family amounted to almost USD 70 million, mostly invested in the EU and USA. As a minimum, we urgently need to tighten restrictive measures against recognised authoritarian regimes, directing such measures against their personal and commercial activities within the EU. I welcome the basic idea behind the report that we need to have a consistent policy towards authoritarian regimes. However, we must seek more. We also need a consistent policy towards those Member States that violate the rules. Last week, Human Rights Watch published a report which condemned the EU and its Member States for demonstrating an unwillingness to combat human rights violations within the EU, despite the fact that the EU itself spoke of the importance of human rights and freedoms during the Arab Spring.</literal>

It is important that the EU and its Member States work together with the other democracies in order to ensure maximum effectiveness of these measures.

In that regard, it must set an example and impose sanctions on those who violate human rights and fundamental freedoms. Any EU sanctions regime must respect the principles of legality and proportionality and avoid penalising the populations of the countries concerned. Otherwise, the cure would be worse than the disease. We must not lose sight of the fact that the aim of these sanctions is to force authoritarian leaders to initiate democratic change, stop oppressing their people and restore the rule of law. I am also in favour of strengthening coordination on an international level. Indeed, the high number of parties involved requires exemplary cooperation in order to implement the relevant instruments. An absence of coordinated multilateral action would result in less effective sanctions.

This opinion of the European Parliament is based on the results of several public consultations, as well as the conclusions of the European Court of Justice, that too many disparities still remain in the national legislation of the Member States applicable to company establishment, preventing the exercising of the freedom of establishment, and a harmonised regime should therefore be established throughout the EU. The harmonisation of such a legal regime applicable to company establishment throughout the EU would facilitate the removal of many administrative obstacles and a reduction in the social and tax costs of establishing a company in another Member State.</literal>

With regard to the interdependence between the registered office and place of business, this is not justified as the place of business cannot be transferred by transferring the registered office.

Company mobility still encounters high administrative burdens as well as social and tax costs. Transfers of seats should maintain the continuity of the legal personality of the company or firm concerned, in order to ensure its proper functioning. The transfer should not affect the rights of stakeholders. The transfer procedure should be governed by strict rules as regards transparency and the provision of information to stakeholders prior to the transfer being carried out. I also believe that when the seat of a company is being transferred, it is important to ensure the coherence of the employee involvement procedures between the different legislative provisions contained in the company law directives.</literal>

               –On 2 February 2012, I welcomed this document because company mobility still encounters high administrative burdens as well as social and tax costs. There is therefore a need to establish relevant measures to implement the freedom of a company to transfer its seat. The Commission must submit a proposal for a directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats, bearing in mind that all companies and firms must be guaranteed freedom of establishment. Transfers of seat should maintain the continuity of the legal personality of the company or firm concerned and thus ensure its proper functioning. The transfer should not affect the rights of stakeholders (minority shareholders, employees and creditors) originating before the transfer. There is a need for legal certainty and compliance with all legal, social and fiscal conditions. It should also be noted that cross-border company migration is one of the crucial elements in the creation of the internal market.</literal>

               –The cross-border transfer of company seats to states outside the European Union poses a problem which has an impact on the labour market, especially as the EU’s concern during this period is to increase the workforce’s level of employment. There are 23 million unemployed at the moment across the European Union, including 5 139 000 young people under the age of 24, which is a cause for concern for all European states. To counter the impact of this problem on the labour market, I think that the public and private sectors need to be administered efficiently, with a dynamic partnership between both sectors, thereby providing an environment that is conducive to investment and ensures better use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.

The freedom of cross-border company migration enshrined in the EU Treaty is a basic feature of the functioning of the internal market. In light of this, I think that the free movement of workers within the EU has a key role to play, making a significant contribution to narrowing the current disparities between regions.

The ambitious objectives for reducing youth unemployment and supporting economic growth, presented by the Commission as part of the informal Council meeting at the start of the month, may be achieved by increasing company and worker mobility within the EU.</literal>

As the EU area is based on recognition of the freedom to establish companies, company law must constitute a priority subject for regulation, since a number of barriers to the smooth workings of the internal market could be raised in this area. In view of this, Parliament is recommending that the Commission table a 14th Company Law Directive, on the cross-border transfer of registered offices. Within this framework, it will have to consider the interests of shareholders, who should not see their pre-transfer rights set back by the relocation of the registered office, the interests of the company itself, and finally the interests of the employees and all those involved with the company.

Locating production in markets that offer very competitive supplies, in terms of raw materials but, above all, of labour, or that have less onerous tax systems, is nowadays one of the main solutions implemented by firms to deal with globalised markets where competition with emerging economies is increasingly strong. The continuity of the legal personality of the transferred company, its recognition in the destination Member State and in the home Member State, as well as the legislation applicable to the company undergoing transfer, are, however, all issues that come under the legal systems of the countries involved in the transfer and, in particular, the type of connection with and recognition of the companies that Member States choose to adopt. My vote in favour of the text this morning is therefore aimed at seeking a measure capable of bringing the different laws of our Member States closer together.</literal>

With this report, Parliament therefore calls on the Commission to act on a number of important measures to improve the management of humanitarian aid. As stressed by the rapporteur, it is essential to ensure that partners effectively follow up on the findings of audit procedures, and it is important to guarantee that UN reports, drawn up case by case, clearly contain information on the results of individual projects in the area covered by the financial intervention. It is also important to improve the methods for, and practice of, assessing potential partners in the context of framework partnership agreements and, lastly, to pay careful attention, from a strategic perspective, to the possibility that in some cases, humanitarian aid policy may have a negative effect, such as, for example, the chance that food aid might drive down the capacity for local production.

Checks on the use of funds also have to be tightened where the EU delivers humanitarian assistance through joint management together with other partners – the United Nations and other international organisations. In cases of joint management of humanitarian projects, budget implementation and control are delegated to international organisations, and the European Commission only conducts field monitoring and verification missions. In the context of the discharge procedure, the European Court of Auditors and Parliament have frequently criticised the joint management method of international organisations. The criticism is due to the lack of coherence and rigidity, as well as the various sources of confusion stemming from the many added layers of legislation, which are a major cause of errors. Weaknesses in terms of control and follow-up of the use of EU funds have also been the subject of much criticism. This report therefore proposes replacing the joint management method with indirect management, and this would strengthen the responsibility in relation to the Commission of the parties managing the budget.</literal>

               –It is well known that the European Union is the main donor of humanitarian aid in the world. This humanitarian aid is granted in the form of financial aid, goods, services and technical assistance. The purpose of this European policy is to intervene in emergencies when countries outside the EU are affected, regardless of whether they are affected by natural disasters or by other kinds of crises.

The EU’s total humanitarian aid contribution, including from Member States, was EUR 2.957 billion in 2010, with EU Member States providing 64% and the funds channelled through the Commission amounting to 36%. The Commission must ensure that the weaknesses identified during regular audits of the partners’ systems are promptly remedied by them. External auditors have to continue their efforts to improve the quality of their recommendations to partners, taking into account their specific structures so as to ensure that these recommendations are accepted and feasible.

To make the use of resources and measures more effective, I think that the EU budget must also support actions designed to anticipate, prepare for and avert disasters.</literal>

               The European Union must strengthen its emergency response capacity, given the growing number of major natural disasters. In this context, I recall that Parliament has, for many years, been calling for a more realistic humanitarian aid budget in the interests of remedying the chronic underfunding of the relevant budget lines, making it possible to provide some financial leeway throughout the financial year, and maintaining a coherent balance between the financing of measures to prevent humanitarian disasters and of measures to ensure rapid responses to natural and man-made disasters. In this respect, I welcome the Commission communication on the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, which provides for an increase in the humanitarian aid instrument budget to EUR 6.4 billion over this period. That would amount to an annual average of EUR 915 million, as against EUR 813 million in 2007-2013. I also note with satisfaction the increase in the Emergency Aid Reserve for the same period, bringing it up to EUR 2.5 billion, as well as the proposal for unspent funds in the reserve to be carried over to the following year. The EU budget should support actions designed to anticipate disasters, prepare for them, avert them and react more quickly to them, as well as measures ensuring greater flexibility in launching development measures as a means of overcoming crisis situations.</literal>

               –The directive is certainly progressing towards better management of humanitarian funds, starting with improved transparency and more vigorous checks to prevent fraud and corruption. Above all, it is essential to take action to remedy the general character of the reports submitted, from which it is particularly difficult to obtain sufficient information on the results, output and outcome of projects.

Furthermore, I welcome the report’s strong emphasis on the need to create continuity between emergency interventions and development programmes. In particular, it might be worthwhile considering a period of cooperation between emergency bodies and development bodies by implementing some form of transfer of deliveries. It is only with difficulty that those who effectively manage emergencies then also prove ready to deal with the problems associated with development projects. It is vital to go beyond the current system which risks creating discontinuity, cancelling out or undermining the potential long-term results.

Lastly, the call for greater visibility for actions, not for ‘publicity’ purposes, but to enable better streamlining of interventions, is valuable and should be supported. This is why I voted in favour, and we must hope that account is taken of the recommendations contained in the report during the process of reform of the framework partnership agreement (FPA).</literal>

               –The frequency and scale of humanitarian disasters have grown to an alarmingly high level recently. The earthquakes in Haiti and Japan, Cyclone Thane in India, flooding in Pakistan or drought in Somalia would be just some of the most serious examples of disasters, not to mention the humanitarian impact of the civil revolutions which have engulfed the whole world. An ever growing number of refugees need food, shelter and medical assistance. Millions of children are undernourished and, unfortunately, many of them, after receiving treatment, end up in the same situation due to a lack of food. Furthermore, the problems caused by natural disasters are exacerbated by the acts of violence which prevent humanitarian organisations from reaching those in need of help. In these circumstances, I join my colleagues in sounding an alarm bell with regard to making these programmes more efficient. I call on the Commission not only to improve the controls over and monitoring of the funds earmarked for humanitarian aid, but also to impose a bilateral audit and measurable impact indicators, in cooperation with its partners, as part of funding humanitarian programmes.</literal>

The importance of this control is even more relevant when we take account of the fact that the EU – Commission and Member States – is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid: EUR 2.957 billion in 2010, with 64% from the Member States and 36% in funds channelled through the Commission, and that ECHO has 40 offices across the globe that award aid to around 200 organisations.

More efficiency and effectiveness, sustainability, consistency and complementarity of humanitarian aid actions: these are the major issues with which this report is concerned. Examples include the proposals that ‘cost observed for results’ methods be used when choosing partners, that EU responses to natural disasters be faster, and that evaluations and audits – involving the European Parliament more in their analysis – be continuous and systematic, so that it can be properly understood what has happened to aid sent to third countries, such as the Horn of Africa, Haiti or Pakistan.</literal>

In 2010, this amount was EUR 2.957 billion, approximately one-third of which was used as European Commission aid.

The implementation of EU aid policy is the responsibility of the European Commission’s Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO), which supplies aid to those in need through 200 partner organisations and specialised UN agencies, and with the help of NGOs.

Appropriate control by the competent bodies of the EU over the use of Community funds spent on aid is extremely important, and in this regard, the European Parliament has a special role.

There are, unfortunately, frequent reports of the improper use of funds by the authorities in recipient countries and even of their embezzlement, to the detriment of populations in need, which are often in a state of health and food emergency. One of the mechanisms undoubtedly available to the Union in evaluating how humanitarian aid is provided is budgetary control. The purpose of the measures proposed by the Commission is to make the humanitarian aid budget more transparent and make those who manage it more accountable. I hope they will bear fruit.

Europeans are immediately ready to help communities in crisis situations, whether in Europe or on another continent. The own-initiative report under consideration, drafted by Mr Ehrenhauser, concerns the implementation of EU financial resources in humanitarian aid, taking into account the recommendations included in the report by the European Court of Auditors, specifically regarding control of funds transferred to NGOs. At times, there is so much bureaucracy involved in implementing many humanitarian aid programmes that the cost/benefit relationship in interventions is far from satisfactory. Moreover, there are major cost differences between comparable projects, which is unacceptable. As such, and without jeopardising the continuity of these programmes, there is a need to adopt measures that will contribute to making them more effective. I voted for this report, since the proposals it contains, in addition to being a clear investment in preventing new disasters, represent a move towards greater transparency in the allocation of funds and better evaluation of the results obtained.</literal>

In order to change existing weaknesses in the control and management of ECHO’s budget, the rapporteur proposes a series of measures that will improve the humanitarian assistance situation in the EU. The most important of these measures is the need for increased control and accountability in the indirect management of EU funds, and for the EU to increase its capacity to respond to natural disasters; that is, a ‘more realistic’ approach to the budget, and ‘maintaining a coherent balance between the financing of measures to prevent humanitarian disasters and measures to ensure rapid responses to [...] disasters’.</literal>

Of the total EUR 9.8 billion of humanitarian aid provided worldwide in 2010, 41% was delivered by the EU (accumulated by funds from the 27 Member States in addition to the Commission through DG ECHO). These funds allow the EU to show solidarity and provide immediate relief to regions hurt by natural and man-made disasters. The EU’s growing involvement and importance as a humanitarian aid provider is on the rise, and so are the requirements to ensure proper use of taxpayers’ money; thus, I welcome the current report, which reviews the budgetary control of EU humanitarian aid management by DG ECHO. Identifying areas of weakness in control over the funds and proposing points where improvements could be made is important for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian aid money. However, I also believe that the evaluation process should take account of the fact that most recipient countries do not have the proper means to provide a full account of how money was spent, especially in a time of emergency. Therefore, we must also show flexibility and adjust our budgetary control requirements to the existing capacities of the recipient countries, in order to ensure our money is properly spent.</literal>

It is a problem that the budgetary plan and budgetary controls in these areas are not managed centrally by the Commission, but that this task is entrusted to various international organisations, which carry out internal controls according to their own accounting and auditing procedures. Since the principle of exclusive or single auditing is pursued, the Commission does not perform any audits of its own. It limits its activities to field monitoring and verification missions.

               –I welcome this resolution because due to the dramatic increase in the number of humanitarian disasters, it is particularly important to ensure sound financial management based on the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The EU is the world’s largest donor of humanitarian aid. Therefore, the European Commission’s Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO) must have sufficient financial and human resources to enable it to properly exercise its powers. Carrying out accurate and coherent needs assessment is a prerequisite for the effective and efficient delivery of humanitarian aid. When delivering assistance, we must use innovative approaches and promote the continuous involvement of beneficiaries in the planning and management of aid. Given the constant increase in various major natural disasters, the EU must strengthen its response capacity. Attention is drawn to the fact that in order to achieve these objectives, it is very important to finally draw up a realistic humanitarian budget.</literal>

Retaining this policy is essential if the EU and its Member States are to have a role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

The EU uses this sum and accumulated reserves to fund around 200 partners, from NGOs to international organisations, such as the specialised agencies of the UN. These funds are channelled into humanitarian aid and civil protection for the victims of disasters and prolonged conflicts. It is crucial to establish levels of control so as to know for certain how funds are spent, as well as to hold both parties – donor and recipient – accountable.

The European Union must also strengthen its reaction capacity, given the growing number of major natural disasters, and provide an adequate humanitarian budget in order to avoid, therefore, the chronic underfunding of the budget lines for humanitarian aid.

At the same time, some financial leeway must be provided throughout the budget year, which will also maintain a coherent balance between funding measures to prevent humanitarian disasters and measures to ensure a rapid response to emergencies, no matter whether they are man-made or natural disasters.</literal>

               – I voted in favour of this resolution which addresses the exchange of views on the Commission’s public consultation examining possibilities for introducing a system of collective judicial recourse (‘collective redress’) at European level. The report highlights the principle that anyone who has suffered damage must have the right to receive compensation, but that those bringing collective actions must not be in a better position than individual claimants. The EU legal tradition is directed towards solving disputes between individuals rather than through a collective entity. Some Member States’ legal systems have developed differing approaches to the issue of collective redress. It is in this context that the Commission must put forward evidence that, pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity, an action at EU level is opportune. We, Members of the European Parliament, agree on the need for this new legal initiative and on initially proposed horizontal procedural actions and safeguards which should be further analysed, tested and developed.</literal>

Cross-border trade is very slow to develop in the EU because consumers have no guarantee that their rights will be protected in the event of a problem and they will receive adequate redress.

The Commission has made a significant effort to address this issue, which hitherto was regulated at Member State level.

As it is a recent legal instrument in Europe, consumers are not familiar with collective redress. The benefits of exercising this right are unarguable. This means that when individual financial claims do not provide them with access to legal proceedings, consumers can initiate a collective action to bring legal proceedings. This also allows the costs incurred by such action to be shared. Collective action provides consumers with an effective means of expression. At the same time, it ensures the most efficient functioning of the single market within which citizens can communicate directly with commercial agencies. I should point out that this mechanism eliminates discrimination among citizens with regard to the value of the legal actions and their admissibility.</literal>

               –Scandals over the PIP breast implants, the Costa Concordia disaster: there are numerous pertinent examples of the citizens’ desire to seek redress collectively when the abuse or damage they have suffered is widely denounced. In adopting the Lehne report on Thursday, 2 February, the European Parliament aims to further the debate on this approach and move towards establishing collective redress within the EU, and I fully support this. This new possibility of collective redress allows claimants in the Member States to group their cases together to denounce mass damage. However, the new system will also have to take into account the lessons learned from the excesses of the US system, which is fighting against class actions that are at times abusive or unmeritorious. To this end, the report calls on the Commission to take into consideration a number of key aspects when drawing up its legislative proposal: limiting the admissibility of actions to clearly defined groups by giving a judge discretionary powers to carry out a preliminary admissibility check of any potential collective action and prohibiting punitive damages. The European Parliament has set the ball rolling; it is now essential for the Commission to fill this legal vacuum by ensuring the fundamental right of victims to be compensated.</literal>

The European Parliament also welcomes the efforts of Member States to strengthen the rights of victims of unlawful behaviour by introducing or planning to introduce legislation aimed at facilitating redress while avoiding an abusive litigation culture, but also recognises that national collective redress mechanisms are widely divergent, in particular, in terms of scope and procedural characteristics, which may undermine the enjoyment of rights by citizens.</literal>

               –A regulation defining collective redress is not only desirable but it is also urgent and cannot be delayed, especially when we consider that, in the majority of cases, the ‘collective’ victims come from the weakest sections of the population, both in terms of education and from an economic perspective. This implies that, in the majority of cases, the infringements perpetrated against these groups go unpunished due to economic barriers (the cost of an individual case being disproportionate to the possible compensation) and psychological ones (fears about the length of procedures) and difficulties in accessing the necessary information.

Vice versa, bundling the claims would not only strengthen their legal position but would also make it possible to simplify the processes and reduce their costs. On the other hand, there remain quite a few problems, both with regard to the different jurisdictions in individual Member States and to the need to curb misuse of the instrument. In any event, it is advisable for the EU to have a common horizontal approach to the issue, without following the US class action model and without amending national laws, and to establish a horizontal reference framework instrument that enables citizens and companies to enforce their rights under EU legislation.</literal>

However, it is crucial that Europe should not repeat the errors already committed in the US, where the practice of class action has become a primary source of profit mainly for a handful of powerful legal firms, only in very rare cases acting as an effective consumer protection tool. In this field, the European Union can do better than the US, first of all by encouraging the parties to reach alternative agreements not requiring formal recourse to legal means, thus simplifying and speeding up the process; and subsequently, by establishing a legislative framework that does not leave room for abuse, hence, with specific timeframes for proceedings, and rights to protection in line with European legal traditions. Only in this way will it be possible to prevent a useful tool for protecting citizens becoming a means of unfair competition between private entities. The report on which we voted today is a move in this direction, and is therefore a good starting point to build on in the future.</literal>

               –The right to compensation for damages suffered is essential to any legal system. The various national jurisdictions already safeguard this. However, I think we need to be cautious regarding collective redress. On the one hand, we do not wish to open the door to a system like that in the United States, in which abuse of the law is commonplace, jeopardising the activity of thousands of companies. On the other, in relation to the area of competition, the existence of collective action will mean consumers harmed by an anti-competitive practice that has been penalised pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will be able to claim damages. This will lead to the associated application of fines and to the compensation of consumers harmed by such practices. Once again, that could have serious effects for businesses. I therefore believe we should proceed with caution in this area, and I prefer alternative dispute-resolution mechanisms that are cheaper, faster and, in many cases, more effective. As such, I consider it crucial that Parliament continues to play an active role in this area.</literal>

Improved access to justice by the European public has been one of the concerns of the EU, which has adopted a number of regulations and directives on this issue in recent years. It is not legal tradition in Europe to settle disputes between individuals through recourse to a collective entity. In view of the complexity of this subject and theof several Member States, it is crucial to harmonise the majority of the branches of national law. In the absence of this harmonisation, it would be preferable for defendants to be tried in the area where they live and to have the right to refuse to participate in a collective redress procedure.

EU legislation is designed to enable parties in cross-border situations either to enforce their rights effectively or to seek out-of-court settlement by way of mediation. The benefits of the alternative dispute resolution method are undisputed and fair access to justice should remain available to all EU citizens.

Consumers affected by a legal infringement who seek redress often face significant barriers in terms of accessibility, effectiveness and affordability owing to sometimes high litigation costs, potential psychological costs, complex and lengthy procedures, and lack of information on the available means of redress. In some Member States, the overall performance of the existing consumer redress and enforcement tools designed at EU level is not deemed satisfactory, or such mechanisms are not sufficiently well known, which results in their limited use.

I believe that it is necessary to take due account of the legal traditions and legal orders of the individual Member States and enhance the coordination of good practices between Member States. Safeguards must be put in place within the horizontal instrument in order to avoid unmeritorious claims and misuse of collective redress, so as to guarantee fair court proceedings.</literal>

               –I am pleased that the European Parliament has undertaken the initiative to introduce legal regulations within the Member States which will allow for and simplify the procedures of consumer collective redress. According to the research and surveys conducted by the European Commission, one out of five European consumers will not go to court for disputes amounting to less than EUR 1 000, and nearly half of them claim that they would not go to court to obtain redress of less than EUR 200. The main obstacles facing consumers include high costs, the risk of court proceedings as well as lengthy and complicated procedures relating to redress. However, in the case of collective action, as many as 79% of respondents declared their willingness to defend their rights in court. We should take steps to empower European consumers, who represent the weaker party in relation to the entity infringing their rights. A mechanism for collective redress already exists in Poland, and its principles could prove useful when working on the future European instrument. As it is a relatively new instrument, introduced by the Act of 17 December 2009, its application still requires thorough testing. However, it is unquestionably a step in the right direction. A common mechanism for collective redress at EU level is necessary in order to make it possible and easier for citizens and businesses to access and exercise the rights to which they are entitled.

In order to achieve a competitive and socially sustainable single market framework, the Union cannot afford to keep putting off the creation of a Europe-wide collective redress mechanism for consumers and citizens. Sufficient amounts of reports, consultations, workshops and seminars have been drawn up and taken place at EU level. It is now time for the Commission to adopt a unified position and take clearly defined legislative action. The formula for completing the EU Alternative Dispute Resolution system, for which the Commission has recently brought forward a legislative proposal, necessitates the putting into place of this collective redress structure. To this end, I feel that for any final ADR package to be endorsed by the European citizen, the Commission must factor in the existence and availability of Europe-wide collective redress.</literal>

               I would like first to state my reticence in relation to exporting the American practice of actions targeting collective redress into EU law. I am particularly concerned about the abuse of these class actions. It is also not entirely clear what impacts the creation of such arrangements would have on the law of individual Member States. On the other hand, introduction of this practice might increase consumer protection and have a preventative effect against some unfair practices on the internal market. Despite my reticence, I voted in favour of the report, as I am expecting an assessment of the impact of the legal measure to be drawn up on the basis of the report. Only on the basis of a high-quality assessment of the impact and the benefits and risks of the practice of collective redress will it be possible to decide whether there is any sense in incorporating this practice into EU law or definitively rejecting it.</literal>

               –As with the preparation of all new EU-level laws, when examining the possibility of collective redress, it is the interests of EU citizens, which, in this case, largely means the injured parties, that must take priority.

Before creating a proposal on the subject, the Commission and all other legislators must provide appropriate justification for this form of legal remedy, which is not entirely known in continental legal culture. While the actual effects of this new type of rules of procedure are surrounded by uncertainty, if we give priority to the interests of individuals, we can highlight some positive results that can be achieved through the common rules of procedure by means of an option of collective redress.

Cases of abuse where the individual assertion of rights can seem hopeless are a frequent occurrence, especially when corporations with extensive capital and infrastructure are involved. Sometimes, the consumer or the client is unable to individually bear all the burdens necessary to enforce his rights provided by the law, and eventually decides not to exercise them. In such cases, joint action by the injured parties, in accordance with the rules of a collective form of redress and strictly based on individual decisions as regards participation, can be justified.

I believe that any future legal instrument, including in the field of collective redress, must focus on the objective of enabling EU citizens and corporations to exercise the rights guaranteed to them by the Community. The report reflects these ideas.</literal>

               –I have always maintained that alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods are the most effective type of mediation in consumer-related disputes. The single market and the Internet have created a virtual trading space which consumers want to be able to trust. Despite this, consumers are often completely on their own against manufacturers. It is a battle between David and Goliath that does not leave room for recognition of the rights enshrined by the directives which we work to protect on a daily basis. Class action is an experience consumers have embarked upon in order to ensure that their voices are heard, as otherwise they would be isolated and therefore weak. Personally, I believe that there should be more incentives for ADR mechanisms, even if they often depend on the trader’s willingness to cooperate. The availability of an effective judicial redress system would act as a strong incentive for parties to agree an out-of-court settlement, which is likely to avoid a considerable amount of litigation. The setting up of ADR schemes at European level should be encouraged, so as to allow effective settlement of disputes as a more attractive option than court proceedings, and have the power to order the parties involved to first seek a collective consensual resolution of the claim before launching collective court proceedings.</literal>

               –Regulation of legal and procedural issues constitutes one of the most sensitive areas of EU law. As such, it is understood that Union regulation began by standardising the commonly set criteria for the international jurisdiction of courts, by determining the commonly set criteria for substantive law applicable to disputes of a certain kind, by supporting alternative means of dispute resolution, or even by introducing procedural models for low-value actions. Therefore, EU-level regulation of collective redress represents progress in this area: in this framework, there will now be a ‘type’ of litigation relationship – mass litigation – that is regulated uniformly throughout the Union. This is an intervention that could meet with resistance, since the regulation to be introduced could clash with certain aspects of national procedural law. In any case, I believe this reflection should take place and become an opportunity to rethink the law on the organisation of the legal system in the various Member States.</literal>

Nevertheless, we need to establish collective redress in Europe: it is clear that when a group of citizens falls victim to the same infringement, individual actions are not always the solution, whether the goal is to put an end to an illegal practice or obtain redress, especially when the individual damage is minor in comparison to the cost of legal action. Of course, as I have already said, these actions must be clearly defined (legal standing, opt-in, no third-party pre-financing, etc.) in order to avoid the excesses of the US system. However, the debate must not cripple legislative action. That is why I supported this report, which sets out a framework within which these actions could be envisaged, even if I do not agree with all of its guidelines.</literal>

Far from protecting consumers, some of my colleagues unfortunately tend to treat them like children instead. Three points would protect the consumer, however. Firstly, this claim was entirely clear: ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’. Secondly, it could be used only if the nutrient content was reduced by at least 15%. Finally, the claim was only allowed to be used for a maximum of one year. Despite the fact that the European Parliament never stops pointing out how crucial it is to combat obesity, reduce the sugar content, salt content, fat content, etc. of our food, it is today adopting an incomprehensible position by rejecting a claim that could, in fact, have given the food industry an incentive to move in that direction, thereby benefiting the health of consumers.

I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament opposing the European Commission’s proposal because I consider that it is a scandalous proposal that paves the way for unsafe food to end up on our plates, because it puts profit before consumer health and safety, and because I consider it unacceptable for the European Commission to turn itself into a mercenary for the food industry lobby and self-serving solutions.</literal>

The motion for a resolution under consideration, pursuant to Rule 88(2) of the Rules of Procedure, contains Parliament’s opposition to the draft Commission regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 with regard to the list of nutrition claims, because it is considered to suffer from a number of faults, such as running counter to ‘the purpose and content of the basic instrument by being ambiguous, misleading and confusing to the average consumer’.

The proposal of introducing the claim ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ violates the principle of comparative claims, enabling,, the nutritional values of a product to be compared with a previous version of the same product, regardless of the starting level of the nutrient in question. There is also the problem that this type of claim discourages producers from reformulating their products more substantially, as it is easier to reduce a nutrient by 15% than by the amount needed to make a product meet the requirements for the ‘light’ or ‘reduced [nutrient]’ claims. In the end, it was consumers who lost out from this proposal – which Parliament has fortunately rejected – in terms of the clarity, relevance and objectivity of the information provided.

               –In view of the basic principles governing the selection of permitted nutrition claims on foodstuffs, the Commission has proposed the new nutrition claim ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’, to be included in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. This claim runs counter to the purpose and content of the basic instrument by being confusing, ambiguous and misleading to the average consumer.

The newly introduced claim ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ violates the principle of comparative claims, as laid down in Article 9(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. It makes allowance for the nutritional values of a product to be compared with a previous version of that product, regardless of the starting level of the nutrient in question, which could be excessively high by comparison with other products on the market. Products that have not been reformulated, but are nevertheless lower in a certain nutrient than the reformulated product of a different brand, will not be allowed to bear a nutrition claim.

This will inevitably mislead consumers. I believe that the draft Commission regulation is inconsistent with the purpose and content of the basic instrument, and I therefore consider it necessary that the Commission presents an amended proposal.</literal>

               –This vote was a significant missed opportunity to allow our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to communicate the improvements they have made to products in terms of reduced salt, sugar and fat content. I would like to point out that under current legislation, companies wishing to improve nutrition characteristics have to make drastic changes to their recipes, a difficult operation for SMEs in terms of both technology and economics. Using comparative nutrition claims is, in fact, currently only permitted on condition that the product contains at least 30% less of the substance indicated than the average in the product category. Use of the proposed claim would only have been allowed for one year, in order to encourage the gradual reformulation of products. This would have allowed consumers to get used to the gradual reduction in fat, sugar and salt content, with the resulting health benefits. There are already successful examples of this approach, such as in the UK where people are becoming used to less salty flavours through a gradual reduction in salt content. Therefore, I hope that the Commission will formulate a new proposal as soon as possible with which Parliament will be able to agree.</literal>

               –I welcome the motion for a resolution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety with regard to the list of permissible nutrition claims, as it will mean that consumers will not be confused by the nutritional advertising claim ‘now contains X% less sugar (or other nutrient)’ when buying foodstuffs.

Although I support the efforts of the food industry to make the content of food ‘healthier’, this new advertising claim will lead to a lack of transparency for consumers rather than encouraging the industry to invest in ‘improving’ its products. The food industry continues to have the option of promoting the products with the label ‘reduced sugar’ or ‘reduced salt’, but these advertising claims are only permitted if the content of the nutrient is reduced by at least 30% compared with other products in the same food category. However, the new advertising claim ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ that is now to be permitted does not have any such restriction, and may consequently confuse consumers.

Furthermore, with the claim ‘15% less sugar’, consumers also expect a corresponding reduction in energy content. According to the Commission’s proposal, however, this advertising claim can also be used if the energy content remains the same on account of other additives. As a result, consumers will have the impression that this product contains fewer calories on account of the reduction in sugar content, although the energy content will remain the same.

Particularly where food is concerned, it is extremely important to provide clear, easy-to-understand and transparent information in order to enable consumers to quickly and easily choose between the many different products on offer.</literal>

               –During the vote in plenary on 1 February, the European Parliament decided, by a narrow majority, to reject a draft regulation aimed at providing consumers with extra nutritional information. Parliament’s concern that there would be a desire to take things further, or even too far, led it to adopt a position which was inconsistent with the principles it seeks to defend. Obesity has become a major health problem and we must tackle the phenomenon in a firm and practical manner. This requires progressive and broad-minded measures to ensure that private sector operators are also involved in meeting public health objectives and improving the nutritional quality of food. The initial proposal, which Parliament chose to reject, called for the statement ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ to be added to compulsory nutritional labelling. To employ this claim, a minimum reduction of 15% of the nutrient was required, and its use was limited to one year only, which would have encouraged the food industry to continue strengthening its efforts with regard to consumer transparency.</literal>

The purpose of the resolution tabled by Parliament is to force the Commission to come up with a better legislative proposal. The main problem with the current proposal is the possibility of displaying a reduction as ‘X% less sugar’ on food product packaging. In any case, this wording is clearly misleading. The reduction in sugar does not have any effect on the product’s energy content because the sugar will be substituted by other carbohydrates, which means that the total number of calories will remain the same. In addition, the wording ‘contains X% less’ would distort competition on the food industry market for products which already have a low sugar content, as such wording compares the product with itself and not with the whole group of similar food products.</literal>

In this regard, it is crucial to inform consumers of what is in the food they eat, and encourage the production of foods that contain less fat and sugars.

Furthermore, in the latter case, a reduction of at least 10% (for micronutrients), 25% (for sodium) or 30% (for sugars/fats) by comparison with other similar products is required. Effectively, a consumer might assume that the quantified statement in the ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ claim signifies a greater reduction than that implied by the ‘reduced [nutrient]’ or ‘light’ claims, despite the requirements being much stricter for the latter than for the ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ claim, for which a minimum reduction of just 15% is specified.

The claim ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ is more a way to promote marketing than bring added value to consumer information.

A further problem is that we know that when sugars are reduced, consumers expect a reduction in energy. Yet the text would have allowed the ‘reduced fats/sugars’ claim to be made even when the product’s energy content was still equal to the energy contained in a similar product.

I do not think anybody really disputes that. The issue is precisely how the industry is allowed to communicate this information to consumers, or, in other words, the methodology behind the health claim. And the fact remains that, with this proposed health claim, a product claiming to have ‘x percent less’ fat could still have a very high fat content compared to similar products on the market. This is why a significant majority of us in this House believe that this claim is essentially misleading.

               –I voted for the European Parliament resolution on amending Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 with regard to the list of nutrition claims, which opposes the proposal for amending the regulation.

Food product information must not mislead the customer as to the nature, properties and characteristics of these products. The use of nutrition and health claims must be easy for the average consumer to understand. Unfortunately, in the proposal amending Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 the Commission is suggesting a new nutrition claim to appear on food products as follows: ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient: sugars/fats, salt, etc.]. At the moment, there are already claims such as ‘reduced [nutrient]’ and ‘light/lite’. The ‘light/lite’ claim means a reduction of at least 10% (for micronutrients), 25% (for sodium) or 30% (for sugars/fats) in comparison with other similar products. The new wording being proposed is ambiguous, misleading and confusing for consumers and might act as a disincentive to producers to meet the requirements for the ‘reduced [nutrient]’ and ‘light/lite’ claims, as it is easier to reduce a nutrient by 15% than by 30%.

We call on the Commission to table a new proposal for amending the regulation which contains clear provisions on nutritional value and which will not be confusing for consumers.</literal>

               – This resolution had my support as I felt it unfair to mislead customers with wrong nutritional information. The proposed changes would have allowed ‘of X% less...’ on sugar, salt and fat content. This could have made food appear healthier than it actually is and make it harder to compare products. Our intention is to maintain a healthier population through encouraging companies to reduce the sugar, salt and fat content in food. The proposed changes would have instead provided a disincentive to improve the nutritional benefits. Labels should be kept as clear as possible, allowing consumers to choose food according to their true nutritional value.</literal>

               – I want food labels to be simple and honest about what is inside them. So today was a victory for consumers, as the European Parliament supported me and my colleagues from across Parliament who objected to a new ‘X% less’ nutrition claim on food labels. The proposed claim had the potential to be very misleading. Given the number of nutrition claims already allowed, it is already hard for consumers to know which product is the best for themselves and their family. In particular, the new claim could have caused confusion with the existing ‘reduced’ claim, which actually requires a larger reduction of 30%, and this must be in comparison with a range of similar products on the market rather than previous versions of the same product. Now that Parliament has said no to this claim, the Commission will have to rethink their approach. Nutrition claims should be used to allow consumers to make healthier choices, if they want to, and not as a marketing ploy. We want to encourage manufacturers to reformulate their products to make them healthier, but it has to be meaningful, and not misleading.</literal>

               – I, like millions of other consumers, am confused every time I visit the supermarket. Labelling on food which tells me that an item contains 10% less salt or 20% fewer colourings is meant to be informative, yet, as often as not, such labels lead to mix-ups and misunderstandings. 10% less than what, I ask myself? That is also a question that this report has asked. I think that it has come up with the wrong answer. When I buy a packet of crisps telling me that it now contains 10% less fat, I assume that means that it contains 10% less fat than the previous recipe for the same product, rather than 10% less fat than a similar product. It is important that we all eat well and have the right information to be able to make the correct health choices, but this report makes things 100% more confusing rather than 100% clear.</literal>

It should indeed be stressed that several of the measures contained in the Treaty resulted from European Parliament debates.

Furthermore, there are two things I regret: firstly, that the final text does not take account of Parliament’s call for its President to be involved in euro area summits, and secondly, that the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic were unwilling to ally with us on this issue.

I think that the commitments made on budgetary discipline will bring about the fiscal stability required for a sustainable economic recovery. The restriction on the public debt and budget deficit of the States party to the Treaty will create the conditions for genuine prosperity based on economic development and not on loans. I also welcome the commitments made by the Heads of State or Government to boost economic growth by creating new jobs and reducing unemployment, especially among young people. I think that it is very appropriate to use EU funds to support the creation of SMEs. I also welcome the initiative to use unspent EU funds as security for young entrepreneurs to obtain bank loans. In the case of Romania, which is lacking in its absorption of EU funds, these measures are particularly useful because it will make it possible for the unspent funds that are allocated to be used to create SMEs and generate new jobs. I hope that the European Council meeting in March will adopt a consistent plan for implementing these decisions, including specific programmes for stimulating employment.</literal>

The Member States need to stabilise their public finances. Austerity measures and budgetary stability are only part of the solution to the crisis. Europe is facing an ageing population while, on the other hand, the youth unemployment rate has never been so high, meaning the Member States are facing enormous challenges. The Member States need to implement structural reforms in order to overcome these obstacles. Europe should also focus on measures leading to economic growth and on promoting competitiveness.

Yet, our Heads of State or Government persist along the path which has widened the gap between the people of the EU and the EU itself. After having ignored EU citizens’ referendum votes on the Constitutional Treaty, they signed a new Treaty amongst themselves, which was negotiated practically behind closed doors and focused on austerity and budgetary discipline. There has been no real inclusion of the European Parliament, no public debate and no cooperation with national parliaments. Moreover, in terms of content, there is nothing on growth or future investment. As I said during the vote on our previous resolution, I am more than doubtful about this new Treaty. I therefore voted against today’s resolution as I feel that it is not critical enough of this Treaty that is being presented to us as the only possible route. As well as being quite useless in content (since many of the measures can be achieved through EU law) and incomplete (for it lacks balance between austerity and growth), it is highly questionable in form: if we want to regain the faith of EU citizens, this is surely not the way to go about it.</literal>

We need to understand that simply making savings is not enough to overcome the crisis in the European Union. In order to ensure fiscal stability, the European Parliament proposes not just making use of the series of measures provided for, but establishing project bonds, a road map for stability bonds and introducing a financial transaction tax at European level, for which the Commission has already made a proposal.

In this sense, I appreciate the reference to the failure to involve the President of Parliament in the informal meetings held as part of the European summits, an infringement of rights that should be quite rightly condemned and deplored.

The problem is also one of defending and reinforcing the positions of political groups fighting for a united Europe, which are confident that the crisis can only be satisfactorily resolved if tackled in a unified manner and if the risk of nationalistic, egotistical breakaway tendencies is prevented. Every day, these groups, particularly in some areas of continental Europe, have to deal with demagogical and populist propaganda that denigrates the EU and its institutions. Our vote is also one of support for these forces.

However, it is also important to emphasise that Europe cannot be bound up and represented only by the austerity measures in the ‘six-pack’, a measure we opposed because we felt it was wrong, and which we still believe to be both incomplete and inadequate.

In addition to the adoption of the International Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, measures were approved relating to economic growth and job creation.

               –It is significant that the majority in Parliament is concerned, not with the fiscal compact or the perpetuation of aggression against workers and peoples and against national sovereignty that it represents, but only with the method and, in particular, with their own participation in the process. With the necessary cosmetic changes made, which guarantee the European Parliament its customary role of decorative element throughout the process, they are now ready to accept the inevitable.

For anyone who was unsure about the role of the political groups that signed up to this resolution: the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament; this is another real example of how the almost perfect, albeit at times contradictory, harmony regarding the EU’s course remains unchanged. Not even all the play acting, manipulation and propaganda manoeuvres can erase their role in a process that, if not stopped, will only lead the people and the EU itself into the abyss. However, we face the future with unshakeable faith in the struggle and its escalation in many EU countries, certain that, sooner rather than later, this policy and this course will be defeated.</literal>

               –Monday’s meeting of European leaders was not only informal; I might even call it essentially pointless. The so-called fiscal compact that was discussed will certainly not lead the European Union out of crisis. Austerity and cuts will take us into recession. Ultimately, due to this economic decline, it will then be even harder to pay back debts and they will become an increasing burden.

Although the meeting finally began to discuss the need to restart growth and employment, it was still inadequate and weak. Whereas cost-cutting measures almost look like law, the initiative for growth and employment has remained in the form of a general challenge. From a European perspective, such behaviour is extremely unfortunate. The growth initiative is weak. The role of Parliament in negotiating and deciding these key matters is minimised. However, Europe must remain united and stick to democratic principles and existing legal frameworks.

It is essential that we look for resources that can be sensibly invested in economic recovery. Unused resources from the EU’s Structural Funds, the tax on financial transactions, a stronger EIB, and European bonds.

These are the issues that the summits should be addressing. They will be worthless if this does not happen, and the Union does not have much time left.</literal>

               – The outcomes of the EU summit of 30 January, 2012 were received with mixed reactions by colleagues. From my perspective, I welcome the announcement on the new fiscal treaty and hope it will be implemented without further delays. The Council’s decision to focus on growth as a complementary means to austerity is essential, since strict budgetary rules alone cannot solve the deepening of the crisis. Supporting SMEs, entrepreneurship and self-employment initiatives are the only way to encourage economic expansion, job creation and improving the EU’s long-term competitiveness. On the other hand, I deplore the fact only 25 Members rather than the whole EU decided to join the treaty. Because the agreed treaty does not really guarantee fiscal stability, coordinated action between all 27 EU Members is needed to restore investment and growth to Europe. Another point of contrast to EU shared solidarity is the exclusion of the European Parliament from participating in future meetings on EU governance. As a directly elected body, the European Parliament must be involved on a basis of equality with other EU institutions. Trying to address remaining challenges – the question of Greece for example – what we really need is leadership, flexibility and, above all, unity.</literal>

Indeed, even though the proposed resolution, once again, stresses the fact that the Community method is the only way that a genuine economic and budgetary Union can be implemented and that budgetary discipline alone cannot solve Europe’s economic and financial crisis, the text does not call for a reassessment of the international agreement on a Fiscal Stability Union which Heads of State or Government approved this Monday. We need to tackle the underlying causes of the crisis by reassessing neoliberal policies and denounce the restrictive austerity mechanism with which current and future governments of Member States will have to comply. We also need to underline the extreme technocracy that is being applied in the agreement, which will, in fact, widen the gap between European institutions and European citizens, and finally, we need to point out that the draft agreement will institutionalise a two-speed Europe, with Member States who are party to the agreement, on the one hand, and those who are not, on the other.</literal>

France, along with its partners, is committed to balanced budgets, convergence and the coordination of European economic policies, as the vitality of the French economy also depends on that of the euro area as a whole. Of course, much work still remains to be done. We in the European Parliament, alongside national parliaments, should be able to be involved in and have our say in debates that have budgetary implications for us. Some of the Treaty’s provisions allow for this, and it is through such an approach that a European Parliament delegation was invited to participate in the negotiations of 30 January 2012. However, this resolution does not give sufficient recognition to the progress that this new text has enabled. In reiterating its support for the resolution of 18 January 2012, against which I spoke out, it makes criticisms which are, in my view, excessive. That is why I chose to abstain.</literal>

This genuine austerity plan aims to sanction Member States that fail to meet the budgetary discipline requirements set by Brussels. The EU will thus introduce a genuine cycle of public finance surveillance that will take place annually, from spring. Mr Van Rompuy spoke to us of growth and investment in employment, but ultimately, the only thing to come out of this Treaty is a policy aimed at killing off growth and imposing oversight on national budgets. Not long ago, the Maastricht Treaty deprived us of our monetary sovereignty; now it is our budgetary sovereignty that is being taken away from us. This Treaty sacrifices European nations’ desire for self-determination on the altar of European economic federalism. It is a victory for financial markets and ratings agencies over the EU Member States. The European Parliament’s solutions will only bring more suffering to EU citizens who have already been severely affected by its policies. That is why we voted against this resolution.</literal>

We are critical of measures that diminish the role and relevance of non-euro area Member States. The question arises as to why Poland, for example, a country in which the economy is growing and workers are making numerous sacrifices, and where unemployment is still a problem – which implies that the nation is not living above its means – should be treated any worse than other countries that are experiencing difficulties, but are being favoured simply because they are members of the euro area.

Firstly, I consider it an exaggeration to state that ‘virtually all the elements’ of the treaty can be achieved within the framework of the EU Treaties in force, thus rendering this new treaty unnecessary. In truth, its most important items – first and foremost, the obligation for Member States to include binding rules on balanced budgets in their domestic legal systems – could not be the subject of EU legislation. Secondly, I agree that the treaty does not solve the Union’s current budgetary and economic crisis, but nor is that its purpose; rather, it is intended to prevent future crises. The present budgetary crisis could not be overcome without assuring creditors now that there will not be others in the future. Thirdly, while I entirely agree that a genuine ‘fiscal union’ is much more than budgetary discipline, also including the issue of joint loans for both the national budgets and the Union budget, I do not think it possible to omit the requirement for tax harmonisation. The very idea of the internal market is incompatible with ‘fiscal competition’ and ‘tax dumping’.</literal>

The agreement may be described in three words: pointless, ineffective and wrong. It is fortunately ineffective, because it could have done more harm than good.

Although the EU Council did achieve a declaration on growth, Europe lacks concrete solutions on how to get out of the current recession and economic crisis. The European Parliament, which represents Europe’s 500 million citizens, is not party to this agreement. Such a move does not unite Europe: it only serves to divide it further. In spite of this, Parliament got involved, and was able to influence almost every section of the agreement.

I am not opposed to financial discipline in Europe: indeed, I want to have a debate on accountability, growth and jobs. This agreement on ‘stability, coordination and governance’ does not represent European parliamentarianism. It would perhaps be more apt to call it the ‘EU2’ Treaty. The danger is that the European Parliament will take the place of national parliaments. It is time to look ahead and start to think about solutions to the present crisis.

I am voting for this resolution because I fully agree that the European institutions and relevant Member States should adopt concrete measures intended to stimulate economic growth, to finance small and medium-sized enterprises, to create jobs, and to improve the workings of the single market.

               –I abstained from voting on paragraph 6 of the motion for a resolution on the meeting of the European Council of 30 January 2012, calling for a road map for the introduction of stability bonds. I believe that such a road map would be wrong at present because it would simply ‘reward’ the excessive indebtedness of some Member States and lead to the morally unjustifiable joint and several liability of other Member States. Naturally, in the distant future, the euro area is interested in a joint liquid bond market as an alternative to the market for US dollar bonds, making the euro an internationally secure currency and replacing the dollar in this respect. The right conditions for such a move are still very far off, because, at present, some southern European Member States have no understanding of reasonable budgetary, fiscal and stability policies.</literal>

The Treaty incorporates amendments previously requested by Parliament, in particular: an undertaking that the Community method will fully apply and that stability, coordination and governance will be implemented via secondary legislation, fully involving Parliament; recognition of the rights of the contracting parties whose currency is not the euro to take part in the euro summit meetings dealing with competitiveness, the global architecture of the euro area and the fundamental rules that will apply to it in future; the addition of a reference to the objectives of sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion; a commitment to incorporate the content of the agreement into the EU legal framework within five years.

Parliament insists that economic recovery requires measures to strengthen solidarity and boost sustainable growth and employment. We call for the President of the Parliament to be extended a standing invitation and to participate fully in the euro area summit meetings.</literal>

The Heads of State or Government meeting in Brussels this week has come to an agreement on a draft treaty that includes the following: incorporating the golden rule into the Member States’ constitutions; the reversed qualified majority rule (whereby a minority of States can take sanctions against a State that does not abide by the Maastricht criteria); the introduction of the automatic correction mechanism for national budgets, although the details of the criteria on which it will be based and the institutions that will oversee the system are yet to be finalised … by the Commission. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left has once again opposed this denial of democracy. In response to the shift of sovereignty that has taken place without the slightest involvement of the people, the European Parliament has contented itself with asking for Parliament’s President to attend euro area summit meetings.

When will the European Parliament get it into its head that more Europe is not the answer to the current financial crisis? When will the European Parliament stop rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic and get down to the business of creating growth and jobs by completing the single market and promoting free trade with countries like India? And when, oh when, will the European Parliament realise that no matter how many resolutions it passes calling for an EU-wide financial transaction tax, that no such tax is going to materialise? The European Parliament may wail, gnash its teeth or whimper like a petulant child who wants a bicycle for Christmas, but it will not change the fact that taxation is a decision which needs to be taken unanimously by the Member States and the United Kingdom will not relent in its opposition to an EU-only tax. This is why the FTT will not happen. There are countless other reasons why it shouldn’t happen, first among which is the fact that even according to the Commission’s own figures, it would be tremendously damaging to Europe’s economy.</literal>

The Treaty is to apply to 25 EU countries, but will come into force once 12 countries have ratified it. What happens if a country fails to ratify it, or if a nation decides against ratification? Will the Treaty remain in force for all? The main element in the Treaty is its sole focus on austerity as a means for all policies. The German concept of a debt brake mechanism will not be applied in Germany until 2016 or 2019. No one knows whether this will work.

               –In the interest of the European Union and its Member States, as well as international peace, I voted in favour of Parliament’s resolution on Iran and its nuclear programme.

Over the past few months, Iran has acted on several points to undermine the European Union’s efforts towards international peace. It did so, among other things, by continuously violating Articles 2 and 3 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, shrouding its nuclear programme in secrecy, and threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz, which could have severe implications regarding the supply of crude oil to Europe given the Strait’s strategic importance. This measure could also undermine the current, relatively peaceful situation in the region.

Based on the aforesaid, and on the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency, I believe that Iran’s nuclear programme does not serve peaceful purposes, and that the penalties already imposed and those to be given effect on the basis of the Council decision of 23 January 2012 are therefore justified and serve a peaceful international world order and the interests of the European Union.</literal>

The mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), intended to clarify the ‘grey’ areas in Iran’s nuclear programme, ended on Tuesday without showing any obvious signs of progress. Although the IAEA’s investigation has been ongoing for eight years, it has been unable to establish so far whether Iran’s nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes, as has been constantly maintained by Iran’s leaders, or for military purposes as well. I welcome the unanimous backing given by European Union foreign ministers last week to impose an embargo on Iranian crude oil, but this is only a first step. The reaction from officials in Tehran was to be expected, with the Iranian Parliament wishing to approve a bill suspending completely oil exports from Iran to Member States of the European Union before the European embargo on Iranian oil fully comes into force. This is why the steps aimed at continuing dialogue must be supported and increased so that these situations can be successfully resolved through diplomatic channels.</literal>

These extremely tough sanctions present the Tehran regime with a clear option: either it gives in, bearing in mind the losses suffered from its second biggest client which used to take a quarter of its oil exports, or it resorts to military confrontation to get away from the economic pressure, based on the model Japan adopted in relation to the US during the Second World War.

The solution for overcoming this deadlock must only be diplomatic. This is why I insist on the EU continuing its actions aimed at resuming dialogue. I hope that the permission granted by Iran to the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency is indicative of this.</literal>

This is a decision that seriously threatens Iran’s sovereignty and the Iranian people’s right to live in peace, and it could also have extremely negative economic consequences for several countries. These unilateral sanctions are also profoundly hypocritical, imposed as they are by nuclear powers like the US, France or the UK.

               –It is quite indisputable that Iran is failing to fulfil its international obligations in the area of its nuclear activities. If its international obligations are to be anything more than a scrap of paper, they must be both enforceable and enforced. In this respect, it is right and proper that the EU has resorted to sanctions. It must be ensured, however, that the sanctions are effective and that the leaders of the regime, who can change things, suffer, and not ordinary Iranians who are not responsible for the situation.

Apart from sanctions, however, the greatest possible emphasis must be placed on the second dimension of diplomatic relations with Iran, that is, namely negotiations. Baroness Ashton, the ministers of the Member States and the Council should initiate a dialogue with Iran. This should not only be about the disputed and sensitive issue of Iran’s nuclear programme, but also about other topics, such as stability in the region, relations with neighbours, and human rights.

If a consensus could be reached in one area, if a partnership of trust can be established, then there will be a greater chance of agreement in other areas, including the nuclear programme. I am therefore of the opinion that the diplomatic activity of European representatives with regard to Iran should be multi-faceted and should include efforts to emphasise diplomacy in the original sense of the word; that is to say, negotiations.</literal>

Unfortunately, until now, these concerns have only resulted in declarations without actions. It is extremely important that Europe has now finally decided to act and to impose clear and real sanctions upon Iran. Iran has to stop any nuclear plans that have military components. And it has to allow independent international specialists to observe and have a close look at its plans. The IAEA has to be allowed to enter the Iranian nuclear sites to see the real situation. I find it very regrettable that similar sanctions cannot be imposed at UN level, due to the Chinese and Russian veto. The EU needs to push for consistent sanctions also at UN level and remind China and Russia of their obligations, and call especially on Russia to halt any proliferation to Iran contributing to the nuclear plans.</literal>

It is essential that Iran immediately stop developing enrichment technology, which is far beyond the needs of ensuring a secure supply of fuel for civilian purposes, and ignoring international concerns about clandestine military intentions. If not, a phased embargo on imports of Iranian crude oil to the EU will have to be implemented and it will be possible for the contracts already concluded to be implemented until 1 July 2012.

I consider the conciliatory wait-and-see approach in the hope that Iran will one day return to the right path of its own accord to be unrealistic. Since Iran is not cooperating, and therefore proof cannot be obtained that it is not breaching its obligations stemming from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it is necessary to act in the interest of protecting the peaceful coexistence of nations.

In this area, the Member States should act consistently with this objective and examine thoroughly whether, under their trading relationships, they have not exported technologies that might be used to develop nuclear facilities for military purposes.

Iran must immediately provide answers to all the questions that arise, resume negotiations, and provide IAEA inspectors with full access to documents, sites, infrastructure and people.

In the medium term, China will take the opportunity to use the capacities thus made available to cover its own growing energy needs. This would balance the losses from the EU embargo, so that there would be no further pressure on Tehran. In other words, the oil boycott would not achieve the desired effect and the EU would be placed at an even greater disadvantage in geostrategic terms. We will have precisely the situation that exiled Iranians have warned against: the measures will hit the wrong people and will fuel anger against the West in increasingly large swathes of the population. For this reason, the EU should seek to exert a moderating effect on both sides, using all its resources to avoid an escalation. The fundamental aim should be that there should be absolutely no nuclear weapons in the Middle East. Nonetheless, the security of Israel must be guaranteed.

I support the embargo decision in view of the concerns that the Iranian nuclear programme has aroused in the international community due to suspicions that it has a military dimension, which have been accentuated since the publication of the IAEA’s latest report on 18 November 2011.

I am deeply convinced that there is no better way to solve the conflicts than a peaceful way.

The Iranian authorities’ failure to cooperate with the competent authorities, specifically the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), over the course of the implementation of their nuclear programme has impeded the development of profitable relations between Iran and the international community. These differences, and the suspicion that the nuclear programme has military rather than peaceful aims, led the UN Security Council to adopt resolutions in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010. The recent phased sanctions on Iran imposed by the EU are in line with the latest IAEA rapporteur, of November 2011, who accuses Iran of developing nuclear technology for military ends. I completely support the imposition of new sanctions on the embargo on oil and associated products, but phasing the sanctions themselves demonstrates a lack of clarity and political will, since the full measure will only come into force in July, following reassessment in May. Iran’s threats, in particular, its threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, are clear indications that there is an urgent need to return to diplomatic negotiations, since stability in the region is essential to maintaining world peace.</literal>

               –I voted for this report because it provides a valuable contribution to defining new European competences in the area of sport. I welcome the emphasis placed on the educational and cultural value of sport, in addition to promoting a healthy lifestyle. Especially as we are in an Olympic year, I should stress that the spirit of fair play and the peaceful nature of competition are key features of sport, allowing it to fulfil its social role. I condemn displays of violence, hooliganism and racism during sporting contests. They must be stamped out because they go against the very spirit of sport. I welcome the report’s provisions in this area, including the proposal to ban supporters who have displayed violent behaviour from entering any stadium in Europe. I regret the violent incidents which have occurred at some football matches in Romania in recent months. I hope that the Law on combating violence in sport, announced right at the start of this year, will help eliminate this behaviour during sporting contests. I should point out that the law includes measures such as stiffer penalties and a significant increase in the size of the fines for acts of violence, not to mention additional training programmes for security staff and stewards.</literal>

               –Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union gives the EU a new competence for sport. Sport contributes to achieving the EU’s strategic objectives, as it highlights fundamental educational and cultural values. It is also a vector of integration, since it is open to all members of the public, regardless of their sex, ethnic origin, religion, age, nationality, social situation or sexual orientation. Sport is an important phenomenon and a social asset. For many, it is even one of the most important forms of recreation, promoting the active participation of the European public in society and helping to develop a feeling of social inclusion, in addition to the undeniable health benefits. This report also highlights the urgent need for a more active approach by the EU in the fight against doping, violence and intolerance,, and in the regulation of a broad economic sector that is growing rapidly and employs 15 million people, directly and indirectly. I voted for this report because I think the measures provided for therein contribute to developing sport and to realising the objective of giving it a European dimension.</literal>

               –Just a few weeks after the European Commission announced it would be creating a specific budget for sport, the Fisas report confirms that it is indeed a European issue. It is certainly high time we had a dedicated budget for sport. Although the sums involved are low compared with the amount of money that changes hands in the world of sport (EUR 30 million per year between 2014 and 2020), I welcome this step forward. The European Commission has taken note of the new provisions contained in the Treaty of Lisbon. The Fisas report highlights the fact that sport is a multi-faceted area that has a strong economic dimension and also plays a vital role in society. If we consider the need to value the role of volunteers, to prepare athletes through training for life after their professional sports careers, to combat illegal sports betting, to coordinate the fight against doping, or to regulate the profession of sports agent, there are certainly enough areas for action. These include areas on which I tabled amendments that were included in the final report, such as the protection of minors during international transfers and the need for cooperation between the EU and the Council of Europe, which is very active in the area of sports. Let us now move forward, therefore, on this new basis.</literal>

The report stresses the beneficial aspects of promoting a sports culture, which is a sphere with an inseparable connection to the social dimension. As the rapporteur stresses, we must promote sport and support the creation of intra-Community networks and the exchange of good practice in the sphere of sport. Through sport, it is also possible to promote the social inclusion of disadvantaged categories such as people with disabilities, and to foster the human and social growth of young people. They are increasingly disorientated in a modern world devoid of reference points, in terms of values and humanity. Finally, the reference to the need to properly safeguard traditional, local sports seems to me particularly welcome. Today, large numbers of these are at risk of disappearing, although they represent an invaluable asset without which it will, in the future, be difficult to preserve our cultural traditions and our special local features and characteristics, which are a real added value in the history of our continent.

               –I voted in favour of this report because sport is a sector that is growing very rapidly, both within the European Union and outside. Statistics indicate that the increase in sporting activity has created around 15 million jobs in the EU. The sport sector employs 5.4% of the working population, and it has an annual turnover of approximately EUR 407 billion, or 3.65% of Europe’s GDP. Sport plays an important role in society and helps to strengthen social well-being because it boosts employment and integration and contributes to society and social development. The European Union was recently given new competence for sport and it is urged to contribute to promoting sport. In response to the Commission’s communication ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, the European Parliament proposes that at EU level, the focus should be on issues of international importance such as doping, trafficking, athlete mobility, racism and violence in sport. Parliament also proposes examining and addressing the issues of money laundering, match fixing, human trafficking and the exploitation of minors. There is also a proposal to create a European register of people who have displayed violent behaviour during games in the past. The discussion of such problems at EU level could make a significant contribution to their resolution and this would give the European dimension in sport real added value.</literal>

               –The Lisbon Treaty has provided a new EU competence in the area of sport. However, this does not mean that a specific article has been created for it, but a legal basis is provided for sport in the section of the Treaties on education, vocational training and young people. Indeed, Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union stipulates that the EU’s objective is to promote the European dimension in sport. Sport itself constitutes an important social activity and a public good. For many, it is one of the most important forms of recreation, whether they take part or are only spectators. One of the biggest benefits of sport is that it brings people together, no matter what their origin, background, religious beliefs or economic status. Sport promotes the active contribution made by European citizens to society and helps foster a sense of social inclusion. Doping remains a major threat to sport. The prevention of doping in sport must be based on a clear understanding of the complex nature of this problem, as well as on extensively combining the strategies of all the authorities involved in sport, with the aim of successfully eradicating doping in sport, which is acknowledged as being a serious problem that is detrimental to the fundamental principles of sport. This is why I think that the EU should be more actively involved in tackling doping.</literal>

In addition, every effort should be made to determinedly combat all types of unlawful activity, such as money laundering, match fixing and exploitation of minors, which are a real threat to sport and the values it stands for.

               –I voted for the Fisas Ayxela report because I believe it is an important exercise in setting out priorities for European action in the sporting sphere. I welcome the reference to respect for the fundamental rights of athletes during checks conducted as part of anti-doping procedures. It is vital to ensure respect for these rights, specifically by identifying a Europe-wide procedure to protect athletes and not to leave room at the edges for arbitrary action, which could have extremely damaging effects on the athletes’ careers. The use of biological passports as tools for investigation, rather than prevention, has given rise to highly discriminatory episodes, and led to the end of the careers of some athletes where the burden of proof has been reversed, even without clear evidence of doping. In such a situation, reversing the burden of proof that applies to an accused person runs counter to the fundamental principles of human rights and, in particular, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). I should therefore like to thank Mr Fisas Ayxela for his efforts to guarantee and protect not only the interests of sports federations and associations, but also the freedoms and fundamental rights of athletes.</literal>

We should be grateful. Yet, there are some contradictions that we should point out.

Having encouraged the widespread use of online betting, it is now concerned about abuses of the system, of match fixing and corruption.

At the same time, the EU wants to protect the property rights of organisers of competitions and promote free access to broadcasts and information for all.

The European Commission is now proposing that it acts as a platform for the exchange of good practices and, ultimately, for organising sports events itself. Just as well Baron de Coubertin and Jules Rimet did not have to wait for the European Commission to create the modern Olympic Games or the Football World Cup.

Finally, probably to fight against so-called nationalism, the European Parliament recommends flying the European flag in stadiums and displaying it on athletes’ clothing.

However, this overlooks the fact that the 2006 Football World Cup was viewed by 80% of the evening audience, whereas only 40% of voters took part in the 2009 European elections.</literal>

               –As a former minister for youth and sport, I am convinced that sport plays a determinant role in respect of both the economy and society. Sport represents a link between EU citizens, as anyone is free to practice it regardless of gender, ethnic origin, religion, age, nationality or social situation.

The economic added value of sport in the EU is extraordinary: it provides 15 million jobs (representing 5.4% of the active population) and accounts for 3.65% of European GDP. Furthermore, sport has a positive influence on Member State health care budgets as it favourably affects the health of European citizens. We must not forget about the potential role of sport in invigorating tourism either.

In light of the aforesaid, I agree with the rapporteur that the economic and social role of sport must be further reinforced. It would represent a significant step in this direction if sport could become a beneficiary of the European Structural Funds. Special training courses for outstanding sportspeople who wish to pursue studies in higher education are indispensable. The fight against doping must continue unabated. Sport must be supported in education because (in addition to its numerous other positive effects) it facilitates the dismantling of social barriers and the integration of marginalised groups.

Sport is an effective tool in strengthening European identity. To this end, I support the rapporteur’s proposal for the organisation of an annual ‘European Day of Sports’, the annual designation of a ‘European capital of sport’ and the creation of mobility programmes for young sportspeople where they can learn new training techniques while promoting dialogue among cultures.</literal>

               Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union gives the EU new powers in the area of sport. Sport is unquestionably important for European society, contributing to the maintenance of health, encouraging a positive form of competitiveness between young people, helping to maintain physical activity among the elderly and contributing to social integration. As a branch of the economy, sport contributes to economic growth and supports job creation. Sport also has many negative attributes, of course, such as doping or the violence and indiscipline of fans, which sometimes ends in brutal fights in stadiums or on the streets. In the matter of stadium violence, however, the report by Santiago Fisas Ayxela does not offer any incentive for improvement or suggestion for change. I would therefore like to call on the Commission, the Council and the rapporteur to pay greater attention to this sensitive and complex topic. Some Member States have been more successful than others in dealing with stadium violence. Why not, therefore, make use of the potential that already exists? We must work together to find possible solutions. The report submitted to the plenary is generally balanced and beneficial, and, despite the aforementioned reservation, I will therefore vote for its adoption.</literal>

It proposes that there be ‘a dedicated and ambitious budget for sports policy’ under the new multiannual financial framework, that sport be included on the curriculum at all types of school, and that gender issues be duly taken into account. However, it proposes that ‘mass-participation’ sport – an expression used to distinguish it from professional sport – be supported by contributions from lotteries. It also proposes a European-level ‘supporters’ database and bans any form of political expression by athletes during matches, but opens the door for sport to be used as a means of propaganda for the EU.

Current challenges for effective management in sport include the free movement of citizens and nationality of sportspeople, transfers of players, the integrity of sporting competitions and European social dialogue in the sport sector.

The communication entitled ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, which the Commission adopted on 18 January 2011, states that EU action contributes to the overall goals of the Europe 2020 strategy by improving employability and mobility, though actions promoting social inclusion in and through sport, education and training, and European guidelines for physical activity.

The Commission is currently providing support to sporting projects and networks, either through motivational measures specifically aimed at sport, and, in particular, preparatory schemes, or through existing programmes in a number of relevant areas, such as lifelong education, public health, youth programmes, citizenship, research and technical development, social inclusion, combating racism and environmental protection.

I believe that, given its educational and cultural value, sport can make a significant contribution to the achievement of the Union’s strategic goals.</literal>

In the text adopted today, we are asking, for example, for a ban to be placed on access to stadiums by fans guilty of violent and discriminatory behaviour.

I agree that it is also vital to adopt a more active integrated approach in the fight against doping. As well as running counter to the principles of honesty and fairness in competitive sport, doping represents a serious threat to the health of both professional and amateur athletes.

The EU and Member States should secure dynamic, good healthy living for European consumers and citizens by improving the social role of sports and actively involving all members of society in health-enhancing sport and recreational activities across Europe, particularly in the case of children, considering that obesity and other health-related illnesses are on the rise in younger age groups. Therefore, the Commission should allocate more health-related incentives and funds for projects, in particular, those involving cross-border sport activities. European citizens and, in particular, young people should be given more information related to the availability of sport programmes, projects, scholarships and training, which will help people make full use of the opportunities offered by Community programmes.</literal>

I also enthusiastically welcomed the inclusion of specific proposals in this resolution such as organising an annual ‘European Day of Sports’, the designation of a ‘European capital of sport’ every year, facilitating and promoting mobility programmes for young athletes and sports coaches, and the suggestion to fly the European flag at major international sports events. Sport can help us promote our values. It is particularly important that we support it in all its dimensions, especially at a time when European values and solidarity have been undermined.</literal>

               –I gave my support to the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the European dimension in sport for a number of reasons linked to the substantial role and contribution of sport within a variety of areas. I would like to point out one aspect of sport, however, that I find particularly important nowadays: its integrating and educational role in regard to young people. Sport promotes integration and social inclusion; it teaches children how to work as part of a team and fosters tolerance and respect for others. In addition to sport’s contribution to public health, its educational and social functions make it an attractive means of influencing people’s behaviour.

I share the opinion that sport has the potential to help groups of young people who are vulnerable and at risk to get back on track, and this potential should be developed and supported. On the other hand, it is undeniable that we often witness violence and displays of aggression from supporters of different teams at sports events, especially in football. I support the need for strict and coordinated measures against such misbehaviour as it may not only have direct adverse consequences, but could also have indirect ones, such as negatively influencing the behavioural development of children and young people.</literal>

               –I supported the Fisas Ayxela report because I believe that it highlighted well the main issues requiring intervention by the EU. The Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Union the task of developing the European dimension of sport by promoting cooperation between bodies responsible for sport and protecting the physical and moral integrity of sportsmen and sportswomen. Sport contributes to the attainment of the EU’s strategic objectives, playing an important role in various sectors such as social inclusion, education, training and public health.

However, corruption, money laundering and other forms of financial crime affect sport at the local, national and international levels. Given the extent to which the sector is internationalised, corruption in sport often has cross-border aspects. The Member States should therefore take all steps necessary to prevent and penalise unlawful activities that compromise the integrity of sport.

In addition, with reference to illegal betting, it is vital for the Member States to develop instruments designed to foster cooperation between public authorities, sports authorities and gambling operators in relation to cases of sports fraud, as well as tackling the issue of gambling addiction and the protection of minors in this sphere.</literal>

Sport at all ages is an important area with great potential for improving the overall level of health of Europeans and therefore, the EU and Member States are urged to encourage involvement in sport and to promote a healthy lifestyle, fully exploiting the opportunities of sport, because ultimately, this will reduce spending on health care. I am pleased about the focus on disabled people, encouraging them to take up sporting activities and providing adequate funding to develop sport and competitions for people with disabilities, above all, by giving them access to sport and equal opportunities to participate in sport and use sports facilities adapted to the needs of disabled athletes free of charge.

It concerns me that the report tries to make politics out of sport, and completely loses sight of the essence of sporting ideals. Sport has historically been based on the voluntary involvement, spontaneity and, above all, enjoyment of those taking part. The attempt to truss it up with pan-European recommendations and pan-European institutions under the pretext of promoting universal bliss will, in my opinion, have an effect that is contrary to the rapporteur’s expectations and assumptions. Sport naturally encourages integration, but it should not be misused for the artificial furthering of European integration. The idea of de-nationalising sport by giving greater visibility to EU symbols at the expense of national ones is just a feeble joke, in my opinion. That is one of the reasons why I have not voted in favour of this report.</literal>

Sport is going through a crisis period, particularly as a result of the criminal activities connected with it. It is to be hoped that the European institutions can exercise greater control over the world of sport, given the abuses being seen. In order to tackle such abuse, regulation would, most probably, enable the standard of sports governance to be improved. Therefore, taking action to regulate the activities of sports agents and player transfers, as well as fighting fraud and doping, are all measures that should produce a useful result in these terms. Finally, establishing a ‘European Day of Sports’ and designating an annual ‘European Capital of Sport’ are, in my view, excellent tools for bringing citizens closer to sport.</literal>

Sport is very important from the point of view of maintaining and promoting health, since the absence of physical activity has a detrimental effect on the health of Europe’s citizens. Sport also has an extremely strong economic impact, providing work, directly or indirectly, for 15 million Europeans (5.4% of the working population) and added value of roughly EUR 407 billion. As a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I consider it important that studies be organised at the European level on the distinctive features of women’s sport, the reasons why women and girls stop doing sports and the continued inequality with regard to sporting opportunities for women. The popularisation of women’s sport should be improved, because it is clearly overshadowed by men’s sport, and, as a result, many young girls unfortunately do not consider sport to be sufficiently important.

A combined effort is needed to more effectively identify and combat the increasingly more dangerous substances and processes that are used in doping. It is notable that there is a request within this report for the accession of the EU to the Anti-Doping Convention of the Council of Europe and I would to like to reiterate the importance of European legislation against this dangerous activity.</literal>

               –I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mr Fisas Ayxela. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has led to a revolution in sport, because for the first time, it has created a legal basis specifically for this sector, Article 165. Therefore, we now need more coordinated action at European level to fight doping, violence in stadiums, match fixing and shady deals by sports agents. Through the creation of a ‘European blacklist’, Parliament is asking that fans who are known to be violent or who engage in discriminatory behaviour be banned from all European stadiums. In addition, to fight match fixing and money laundering, Parliament is asking that any fraudulent activity be treated as a criminal offence and that a licensing system be put in place for betting operators. Finally, the profession of sports agent should also be regulated, in the view of the European Parliament. In fact, in order to obtain a licence, agents will have to prove that they have certain minimum qualifications for the profession, that their fiscal residence is within the EU, and they will have to undertake to abide by a code of conduct.</literal>

               –I voted for this report on the European dimension in sport, which is the first in this field to be adopted by Parliament since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force. I welcome the fact that it highlights the important role of sport in promoting intercultural dialogue, public health, the integration of socially vulnerable people, the fight against discrimination, and even the emancipation of women. Another positive point is that the text recognises the importance of volunteers in sport – some 35 million in Europe – and stresses the need to provide them with proper training. Naturally, the fight against doping is a key point in the text: we call, in particular, for prevention and information campaigns to be put in place and urge the Member States to treat trafficking in illegal performance-enhancing substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs. The paragraph suggesting that the European flag be flown at major international sporting events held in the European Union has proved controversial. Considering that this would help strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the same group, despite the European project currently going through some dark times, I supported it being kept in the text.</literal>

The Treaty of Lisbon gave the EU a mandate to support, coordinate and supplement sport policy measures taken by Member States. Sport itself is an important social phenomenon and a public good. For many, it is one of the most important forms of recreation, whether they take part themselves or if they are a spectator. European policies on sport must, in sporting terms, support the fight against doping, while from a cultural point of view, we need to take action to reduce spectator violence and disorder. We must not forget the importance of sport for public health. Indeed, this vote underlines the fact that sport is a major public health tool and a powerful factor for reducing public health expenditure, while also stressing that the positive effects of regular physical activity include the prevention of health problems such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis.</literal>

It is my view that sport is a national matter, and in Sweden, the Swedish Sports Confederation is independent and has a great deal of autonomy. With EU programmes and the introduction of a ‘dedicated and ambitious budget for sports policy’, sport will start to become a more supranational activity instead of being an independent and important element in civil society. Proposals for European coach education within the framework of the Lifelong Learning programmes, measures to enable the financing of sport through lotteries, payment of agents’ fees in instalments and EU flags on sports clothing are examples of measures that I consider to lie entirely outside the realms of politics.</literal>

Sport plays an important part in the European economy as it directly or indirectly employs around 15 million people (5.4% of the working population) and accounts for 3.65% of EU GDP every year. Sport contributes to the population’s state of health, and promoting physical activity and sport can help achieve significant savings in terms of public expenditure on health.

We call on Member States to incorporate physical education as a subject in the curriculum of schools of every kind, and underline the importance of participation in sports at all levels of education and in local communities, which should be encouraged to have sports facilities with suitable equipment.

I feel it is a good sign organising a European Day of Sport every year which promotes the social and cultural role of amateur and professional sport and the benefits of sport in terms of public health.</literal>

We can learn a lot from sport: the EuroBasket tournament recently held in Lithuania demonstrated the enthusiasm, goal striving and unity that is unfortunately lacking in Lithuanian politics and public life. Sport is poorly funded in Lithuania. This is understandable given the economic crisis affecting my country. However, we cannot simply blame the economic crisis for the poor funding of sport. Another problem is the weak administration of Lithuania’s sports system. Last year, LTL 39 million (a little more than EUR 11 million) was allocated to sport in Lithuania. By contrast, Latvia’s sports budget is almost double that amount. There is a need for greater transparency and better administration. Part of the problem is caused by the distribution of funds – while some larger Lithuanian sports federations receive the biggest proportion of funding, several dozen federations are left without a penny. The issue of the sustainable funding of Lithuanian sport should be examined more closely.</literal>

Most of the work done in sport is carried out on a voluntary basis. This is something that cannot be emphasised often enough. For this reason, it is important to me that we should support the great efforts being made by people at grassroots level, while it is a key task for the future to anchor support for sport as securely as possible in all relevant funding programmes. Unfortunately, there is as yet no reference to sport in the draft regulations for cohesion policy, even though other areas are mentioned where sport can make an important contribution. I would call for sport to be expressly mentioned. This would give the Member States a good basis for their operational programmes. The proposal for a sports programme within the ‘Erasmus for All’ programme is also a good idea. I particularly welcome the idea that we should foster sport at grassroots level and as a voluntary activity, rather than promoting top-level sport. This offers an opportunity to combat potential social problems, such as racism, social exclusion, drug dependency or crime, while also promoting the enjoyment to be had in pushing oneself to one’s physical and mental limits in a team.</literal>

I replied that while it may be voluntary, there should be no such reference to the EU flag in sport, be it voluntary or otherwise. I find it increasingly difficult to persuade my constituents of the benefits of a single market when the EU time and time again takes every opportunity to both depart from the original objectives of a community of trading nations and also to impose a federal EU identity on its unwitting and unwilling citizens. Natasha Kuchinskaya, one of the first Soviet gymnasts to take part in the Olympics, described the USSR’s attitude to sport as follows: ‘Sport was considered the prestige of the government. If sport was strong, government was strong’. I am all for a strong trading bloc which creates growth and jobs, but we must resist the EU becoming a manipulative, propagandist superstate.</literal>

It is also about greater communication about the merits of pre-sorting waste, and driving home the point that, although adequate waste management can be expensive, it can attract investment and create jobs. Everyone remembers when ponds containing red toxic sludge were breached in Hungary leading to the devastation of a village, or the landfill, near Marseille, which, in 2008, was close to saturation, despite being well managed.

They have every right to expect public authorities to provide public services that take their health and their environment into consideration. The apparent inability of certain Member States to manage their waste and, in particular, toxic waste, has led to a significant increase in the number of petitions on this matter. Waste management is a major political and social problem. With a systematic over-reliance on landfill, monitoring and control alone are not enough to prevent household waste being contaminated by toxic waste. We need to develop these policies as early in the chain as possible by making improvements to sorting, collection and recycling and encouraging waste recovery, and also by providing an effective tracking system for toxic waste. Landfills should be the last resort. The Iturgaiz report shows us that considerable efforts are still required and reminds us that it is crucial to encourage early dialogue between the authorities and citizens. Awareness among citizens is real; it is up to the public authorities to respond by dramatically improving waste management.</literal>

               –EU policy on waste has evolved in the last 30 years through a series of environmental action plans and a legislative framework whose aim is to reduce the adverse impact on the environment and health and to create a resource- and energy-efficient economy. In some Member States, recycling and recovery are the main waste management options deployed, with a reduction in the use of landfill sites to a negligible level, whereas other Member States still use landfills for most of their waste. This also presents an economic opportunity. Indeed, in 2008, this sector recorded a turnover of EUR 145 billion, which accounted for roughly 1% of EU GDP and provided 2 million jobs. Compliance with EU policy would help create a sector providing 2.4 million jobs and a total annual turnover of EUR 187 billion. If Member States recycled 70% of their waste, this could create at least half a million new jobs throughout Europe.</literal>

The inability of many local authorities to manage waste disposal in the majority of Member States is certainly worrying. Furthermore, the fears of many communities for human health and the well-being of the land emphasise that waste management is becoming a real socio-political issue. An analysis of the current policies shows that only a few Member States are up to speed on the matter and even manage to generate profit by using advanced waste transformation systems. Instead, in the majority of the EU, we can see a worrying delay in implementing strategies for dealing with waste and an excessive dependence on landfills. Accordingly, we urgently need to put in place a coherent policy and work with greater determination to properly apply current legislation by setting out sustainable waste disposal plans. We need to do more, then, to respect the law and improve the waste management process in order to ensure more effective environmental protection and a more sustainable future.</literal>

               –Our citizens are deeply concerned about waste. This report is a wake-up call to Member States. However, the European Commission must also play its part and verify that the Waste Directive is properly implemented. This issue needs to be made visible but also credible. It is of great concern that Member States do not appear to be controlling their waste management situation; only six Member States have transposed the Waste Framework Directive on time, and the large number of complaints received on the matter by the Committee on Petitions often shows the lack of transparency in the choice of landfill site. Parliament also wants to impose sanctions that act as a deterrent to companies linked to organised crime, preventing them from winning public contracts solely for enrichment purposes, on a market worth some EUR 75 billion.</literal>

               –The report results from complaints submitted by European citizens and shows how weak the role of the European institutions and their directives can be if they are not adequately backed up by a comprehensive monitoring network. Accordingly, the report primarily represents an extraordinary demonstration of how a democratic process originating from the grassroots can work and bring results.

In particular, the report highlights the serious delays in implementing the Waste Directive in some areas of Europe, as well as numerous violations of it, including: excessive dependence on landfills, in breach of waste disposal policies; a lack of transparency in procedures for assessing the impact on the environment; and the inaccessibility of information for citizens. In any case, the recent issues affecting Campania – one of the regions discussed in the report – have shown that tangible results can be achieved if the EU method is pursued to fruition, using all the available – and perhaps coercive – tools, making it possible to overcome flaws and structural shortcomings.

The role of citizens and their petitions is to be welcomed, but even more so the ability of the European institutions to fully comprehend their strength and their role.</literal>

At EU level, improving waste recovery and recycling could achieve savings of EUR 72 billion annually, and the turnover for the European sector for waste management and recycling would increase by EUR 42 billion a year and, last but not least, more than 400 000 jobs could be created by 2020.

               –One of the issues that has been leading to an increasing number of petitions is the environment, which is the largest group of petitions received, with waste-related petitions representing a significant subgroup of these. This seems obvious to me, since the problem of waste affects the citizens of the entire EU very directly, particularly as regards procedures for authorising new waste management facilities or operating existing ones, followed by concern about waste management in general: the ‘Not in my backyard’ syndrome. Apparently, the inability of public authorities in many Member States to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management could be a factor in the increase that has taken place. On the basis of 114 petitions which, fundamentally, indicate failings in waste management and the frequent inability of Member States to meet their legal obligations, this report recommends that the Member States should improve the application of waste management policy in the future, that they should speed up transposition of the Waste Framework Directive into national law, and that national authorities should apply necessary and suitable measures for combating the illegal dumping of waste. I voted in favour.</literal>

The Northern Ireland waste management strategy agreed that strong government leadership and effective implementation are crucial to success. As well as making an important contribution to sustainable development, waste management is being reflected in many areas of Northern Ireland government policy. It is the responsibility of individual Member States to apply the principles of sustainable development to waste management in ways that protect and enhance the natural and physical environment and the use of resources and energy as efficiently as possible. In Northern Ireland, we view waste as a valuable resource and, by 2020, we will be recycling and composting nearly 50% of our household waste.</literal>

The rapporteur makes a series of observations that we consider positive, relating, in general, to waste management, to environmental protection and to raising public awareness. However, some aspects of the report are less positive and are bound to elicit comment. The report makes it clear that waste management is a public responsibility, but one that is frequently ensured by private entities. It does not hide that there are two multinationals controlling this business in two or three Member States, making money by the bucket load. Unfortunately, this model is not clearly rejected in the report, as was necessary. Moreover, the report mentions the 2007 directive. However, this directive has a problem: a failure to distinguish between toxic and normal waste has led, in some cases, to situations in which large companies produce toxic waste in ways that are incompatible with the primacy of public health and environmental protection interests.</literal>

               –The majority of European citizens expect public authorities to provide effective and efficient public services in health, education, transport and security. An area that causes an increasing number of petitions, however, is the apparent inability of public authorities in many countries to address the issue of waste management in a satisfactory manner.

The European Union has adopted many laws applicable in all Member States in order to ensure the existence of a legal framework for dealing with the inevitable consequence of our modern lifestyle, that is, items discarded as waste from households, work, hospitals, industry and so on. Inadequate management and an inability to prioritise efforts in this respect not only have negative consequences for human health and well-being, but also have a negative effect on the environment in the broadest sense of the word.

Analysis of the waste management policies implemented in the EU Member States provides very different information. A number of Member States are very advanced, and no petitions were received from their citizens in which problems relating to waste management were indicated. Many other EU countries, however, lag far behind in the implementation of waste strategies. I believe that, in order to improve the effective management of waste, it will be necessary in the future to help improve the implementation of policies in this area.</literal>

There has been a large number of petitions relating to waste management facilities. It therefore makes sense to summarise the main problems in a report in order then to be able to tackle them in a practical way. These main problems include a lack of environmental impact assessments and existing shortcomings in the waste management systems. I welcome the fact that the Member States are expressly called on to speed up their implementation of Directive 2008/98/EC on waste. The Waste Framework Directive contains important regulations which provide for the protection of the environment as well as human health.

Shortcomings in the waste management systems cause environmental damage, such as the pollution of groundwater. This pollution does not stop at borders, but has a cross-border effect. For this reason, the Member States must do everything they can to implement the existing directives for the sake of the health of their own populations and to protect neighbouring regions.</literal>

Member States must ensure that a full and mandatory environmental impact assessment is conducted before any decision is taken to establish or construct a new waste facility, notably, an incinerator or methanisation plant, or, in the worst case scenario, a new landfill. The Commission is encouraged to propose clearer and more specific criteria for the location of landfills in relation to local housing, schools or health facilities in order to ensure more robust guarantees against potential risks to human health and the environment, bearing in mind that there are a large number of variables and local considerations that need to be taken into account.

               –The increasing volume of waste is the result of a modern lifestyle, and is a problem that involves each and every one of us, from major industrial plants right down to individual households. Waste is dangerous both to human and animal health, as well as to our planet’s ecosystem. It is also an equally important issue for rural areas, which generate many types of waste, and where sometimes electrical or particularly hazardous asbestos waste, for example, is dumped next to municipal, biodegradable waste. These areas require proper systems for the regular collection of this waste, and such systems should be accompanied by practical information campaigns.

As we read in the report, the advances made in waste management policies differ quite significantly between individual Member States. In countries such as Austria or Denmark, waste management is very advanced, while other countries, mainly the new Member States, still lack proper legal regulations and administrative procedures. It is, therefore, necessary to implement a harmonised waste management policy.</literal>

               –Numerous petitions submitted recently to the European Parliament highlight that an ever increasing number of local communities are concerned that waste management is becoming a major political and social problem. The very credibility of EU legislation is at stake.

The waste industry in the European Union is a public responsibility, frequently managed by private interests and multinational companies, which handles 60% of household waste and 75% of waste from businesses, with an annual turnover of EUR 75 billion. This is precisely why the European Commission must propose clearer and more specific criteria for locating environmentally-friendly landfills and their proximity to residential areas, schools or hospitals.

I supported the position of the rapporteur precisely because of the measures to combat any infiltration of the waste management system by organised crime and to prevent any links between organised crime and the waste industry or public authorities.

Another important proposal made in the report is that, after allocating the waste treatment funds to companies, the local and/or national authorities must implement effective financial monitoring of the use of these funds.</literal>

The problems facing some Member States in transposing the Waste Framework Directive are also regrettable. I agree with the appeal made to the Commission for more careful monitoring of the transposition process. The issue of waste disposal does not only affect health but also falls within the scope of fighting the infiltration of organised crime in the waste management and disposal process.

Some Member States are lagging behind when it comes to waste sorting, above all because the public are not convinced of its benefits. Secondly, the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process has a significant effect on transparent waste management. When designing and building waste management facilities (above all, incinerators and landfills), a lack of transparency and public ignorance during the EIA leads to waste crises or even disasters (as demonstrated by real examples in Italy, Spain and other countries). During the next review of the EIA Directive, we must therefore really ensure that the public is adequately and genuinely involved in consultations, that public opinion is taken into account, and that the process itself is transparent and independent.</literal>

The 177 infringement procedures opened by the EU reveal that there are thought to be 619 illegal landfills across the European Union. Our citizens are asking for clarity and procedural transparency, and the number of petitions that Parliament receives on waste and landfills speaks volumes: between 2004 and 2010, 114 petitions alleging breaches have been declared admissible. Forty per cent of these concern the authorisation procedure for new plants and another 40% relate to the operation of existing ones, not to mention landfills and incinerators. Figures from Eurostat show that EU citizens produce, on average, 513 kg of waste per year. The questions raised by citizens during the public consultation process and the Environmental Impact Assessment on planned locations for new landfills often concern alleged violations of protected areas, as in the case of the landfill in the Vesuvius national park, or fears over a negative impact on health and well-being. Europe should provide incentives for citizens who are inclined to pre-sort their waste, thereby allowing taxes to be lowered and reducing the impact of waste processing on the land and on citizens.</literal>

               –Each year, a whopping 2 billion tonnes of waste, including 40 million tonnes of special waste, is generated in the EU, which is an enormous amount, particularly in view of our population. If we continue along this path, the rising disposal costs will soon mean that we will be drowning in our own waste. Alternatively, we could follow the US model and simply ship our waste electrical and electronic equipment to the developing world as ‘development aid’. In addition, many materials can only be recycled to a limited extent because they can only undergo the recycling process a limited number of times. In other cases, only a small proportion can be recycled. It is of central importance that we should take control of downcycling, the practice of transporting or illegally storing waste throughout Europe. What might be helpful, therefore, is the combination of an increase in recycling rates together with strict controls on exports of electronic waste and a shifting of the cost burden on to those who cause the waste. Even more important are preventive measures to avoid waste, something that is not given enough consideration in the report. Ordering everyone to use energy-saving bulbs has actually generated more waste, not less. In addition, the amount of hazardous waste produced by nuclear power stations should not be underestimated, while the final resting place of this waste is still undecided. On account of these considerations, I have abstained from voting.</literal>

Furthermore, Member States must carry out inspections, monitoring and other necessary actions at all stages of the waste management chain. I believe that we must establish common EU standards for colour-coding categories of waste, which would be used for sorting and recycling. It is also very important to ensure that mandatory environmental impact assessments are conducted before any decision is taken to establish or construct a new waste facility, particularly a landfill. Furthermore, local authorities should engage in a constructive dialogue with local communities in order to reduce their resistance. Local populations must have a guarantee that permitting and operating authorities are respecting the rules correctly and transparently. I believe that the Commission must impose dissuasive fines for the illegal disposal of waste. There should also be more of a focus on the influence of all types of organised crime on environment-related offences.</literal>

I think that close cooperation between Member State authorities and the European Parliament’s technical committees (Petitions and Environment, Public Health and Food Safety) in dealing with the direct concerns of citizens at local level would provide an excellent opportunity to facilitate dialogue between the responsible authorities and local communities on priorities as regards the implementation of waste management strategies.

               –Europe produces 1.3 billion tonnes of waste each year, excluding agricultural waste. However, waste in general should not be confused with urban waste. In overall terms, Europe’s waste is accounted for as follows: 29% from mining activities, 26% from manufacturing, 22% from construction and demolition, and 14% from urban waste. Europe therefore produces 198 million tonnes of urban waste. Since the population of the EU is 375 million, each European citizen produces 527 kg of waste each year. Despite the efforts made on recovery and recycling, landfills are still the most common solution, accounting for 54% of rubbish. The recycling and composting chain accounts for 27% of urban waste. The remaining 19% of waste is incinerated, with or without energy recovery. The problem of waste disposal is only one aspect of the issue. I feel I must emphasise that the quantity of waste that we produce is the result of our unsustainable lifestyle. Our current systems of production and consumption must be altered in order to minimise pressure on the Earth’s non-renewable resources. Essentially, the production of waste is one of the best indicators of our progress towards sustainable development.</literal>

In the 2004-2010 period, 114 petitions were submitted to Parliament, reporting possible breaches of the waste management regulatory framework from the following Member States: Italy, Greece, France, Spain, Ireland (more than 10 petitions each), Bulgaria, the UK, Poland, Romania (3-10 petitions each), Austria, Hungary, Lithuania, Malta, Portugal and Slovakia (1 petition each).

According to a survey carried out for the Commission, roughly 2.6 billion tonnes of waste are generated every year in the EU, which is roughly six tonnes of waste per capita, while roughly 90 million tonnes of waste are classified as hazardous. The same survey highlights that many Member States lack sufficient capacity for preparing waste management plans and for carrying out inspections, controls and other actions required to implement waste legislation properly.

The resolution calls on the Commission and Member States to establish and implement comprehensive waste management plans, including the adoption of all the goals set by the specific European legislation, as well as solutions for the necessary funding.</literal>

This is, in my view, a key issue, both for its impact on the human health and well-being of Europeans, but also for the environment and sustainable development. I had questioned the Commission on what it was doing to reduce and recycle packaging waste associated with consumer products and on the need to eliminate food waste, which is a significant source of waste and an imperative of solidarity with the poorest citizens. I therefore call again on the Commission to make strong proposals for sustainable waste management throughout the supply chain. This is what Europeans expect, which I think is only fair.</literal>

Violence against children, young people and women still remains one of the biggest challenges to European society. Ninety-eight per cent of European citizens are aware that this problem exists, while more than two thirds of European citizens (68%) think that the European Union must take a more active involvement in preventing and tackling violence against these vulnerable groups. In addition, the spread of new forms of violence against vulnerable groups due to the expansion of access to new communications technologies demands a robust response from the European Union.

It also includes projects dealing with the prevention of child pornography and the risks children face in surfing the Internet as well as the health needs of women who are victims of trafficking and female genital mutilation.

The new-generation programme will pay special attention to women, children and young people who, because of social exclusion and marginalisation, are particularly exposed to the risk of violence. I welcome the calls for the Member States to gather data on violence against women at regular intervals in order to clarify the extent of the problem in the EU, and for the Commission to channel more funding into projects aimed at alerting the public, particularly groups at risk, to new forms of violence linked to the growing use of online social networks (threats, psychological pressures, bullying, Internet child pornography).

The Daphne programme has been a genuine success since its launch in 1997, both in terms of its popularity with stakeholders (beneficiaries, public and academic authorities, NGOs) and in terms of the effectiveness of the projects funded by the programme. It is therefore vital to ensure continued funding for the Daphne programme in order to maintain the measures currently in force and introduce new measures that will be effective in combating all types of violence against children, young people and women. Daphne is an extremely important instrument for raising the visibility of the issue of violence against women and providing the possibility for women’s organisations and other engaged stakeholders to develop their work and their concrete actions in this field. The Daphne programme will, from 2014, be incorporated into the rights and citizenship programme, but it is essential to ensure that the programme’s objectives, in particular, that of combating violence against women, are retained in the 2014-2020 period among the objectives of the new rights and citizenship programme.

Since 2007, the Daphne programme has formed part of the more general ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice programme’ and is the only programme in Europe to combat violence against the most vulnerable people in society. In fact, the objective of Daphne is to contribute to the protection of children, young people and women against all forms of violence and to attain a high level of health protection, well-being and social cohesion. NGOs showed a great deal of interest and involvement in the programme and submitted a far higher number of proposals than could be funded. However, the interim report of the Daphne programme 2011-2013 necessitates a few essential amendments to ensure correct application until its expiry. Greater participation from the States that joined up from 2004 and more effective dissemination of the projects’ results could also be helpful. Lastly, we need to refocus the programmes on the EU’s policy priorities by funding, for example, fewer projects but selecting ones on a larger scale.</literal>

               –The importance of the Daphne programme is plain to see. This is the only programme aimed at combating violence against women, children and young people on a European scale. We therefore need to provide sufficient funding not only to tackle the real needs involved in the fight against all forms of violence, but also for projects aimed at alerting the young in particular to new forms of violence linked to the growing use of online social networks (threats, psychological pressures, bullying, Internet child pornography). We also need to make sure that the Daphne programme’s objectives are retained in the rights and citizenship programme, and that the administrative burden is eased and grant application procedures simplified to encourage small NGOs to propose Daphne projects.</literal>

               I firmly believe that the Daphne programme has significant added value for the EU, allowing various organisations in the Member States to cooperate on preventing and reducing violence, and to benefit from the exchange of knowledge and best practice. Projects funded under Daphne III have created associations and permanent structures which will continue to support target groups in the longer term, and which have prompted policy changes at national and EU level. I consider it important to pay particular attention to projects aimed at eradicating ´honour´ crimes and female genital mutilation. The Commission should allow the funding of national projects involving small non-profit organisations, as they play a crucial role in identifying less well-known, taboo or new problems, and in finding innovative ways to tackle them, as well as in protecting and supporting victims.</literal>

We are supportive of the aims and objectives of the Daphne programme and are particularly keen to see it extend to areas such as preventing violence through online social networks (paragraph 10), honour killing and female genital mutilation (paragraph 13). The ECR Group supports a strong position with regard to violence against women and we want to work collaboratively alongside national governments to make policies which will help eradicate violence against women. We voted against part 2 of paragraph 17 to show that we oppose further legislation at EU level which would interfere with Member States’ own criminal justice systems – we do firmly believe that individual Member States have overall responsibility for their own criminal legal systems.</literal>

               –I voted for this report as violence against children, young people and women is a scourge of our society. According to several studies on gender-based violence, roughly 20-25% of women in Europe have been physically abused at least once, and 26% of children and teenagers stated that they had been victims of physical violence during childhood. However, most times, the victims of physical or verbal aggression are not bold enough to confirm this openly, which makes it difficult to compile relevant statistics. This is why I think that it is of paramount importance for us to provide adequate funding to the Daphne programme, used with the aim of preventing and tackling violence against women, as well as against children and young people.</literal>

               –Since it was created in 1997, the Daphne programme, promoted by the EU and implemented by various NGOs from the Member States, has shown itself to be an important instrument of the policy for combating violence against women, children and adolescents, who are – along with the Union’s older citizens – the most vulnerable groups in the population.

Although it is considered a success, in line with the mid-term review, the report suggests some changes to the Daphne programme by 2013 with which I agree: increased participation in the programme by the newer Member States and those with few projects approved; increased publicity for approved projects to promote benchmarking; and increased adaptation of the programmes to the EU’s priority goals, by funding a lower number of larger projects. I shall conclude by congratulating my party colleague, Ms Bastos, on the work she has done on such an important subject that requires ever greater involvement from the European institutions in combating and eradicating this incomprehensible and shocking form of violence against the most vulnerable groups of our population.</literal>

               –The Daphne programme is the EU programme combating violence against women and children. This type of violence covers a number of serious violations of fundamental rights, such as sexual abuse, attacks on physical integrity and domestic violence, psychological violence, harassment or coercion, the trafficking of women and their exploitation for prostitution, among other examples of aggression that need to be resolutely condemned by the Member States. I condemn all violence, but especially that used against those who are more physically, socially, economically or emotionally vulnerable, such as children and often women too. That is exactly why the Member States must seek to eliminate all forms of violence against women and children, in particular, trafficking for sexual exploitation, violation of their sexual self-determination and attacks on their physical integrity. Finally, I must clarify the fact that the internally accepted definition of ‘sexual and reproductive rights’ includes abortion, so I voted against the reference to it in item K of the preamble.</literal>

               –This own-initiative report, by my colleague Ms Bastos, concerns the ‘Daphne programme’; more specifically, the progress made and future prospects. This is the only European programme intended to protect women and children. Cases of violence used against women are well known and have a steep cost: in Europe alone, domestic violence costs over EUR 16 billion per year. New information technologies mean we are witnessing a new type of violence online, specifically over social media. There is an urgent need to take measures to prevent discrimination against women. I welcome the adoption of any measures that safeguard the objectives of this programme and keep funding levels high. I also hope the projects will be shared out fairly between all the Member States. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done, which I consider excellent. I am voting for the proposal to keep the ‘Daphne programme’ for the 2014-2020 period.</literal>

               –This report rightly acknowledges the importance of the Daphne programme in combating violence against children, young people and women. Since there is a proposal that actions funded by this programme be included in the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework as part of the future rights and citizenship programme, the report urges that the latter should include the objective of ‘combating violence against women’ and retain the same level of funding that the Daphne programme has had to date. We are bound to point out the risk that, under the new conditions just proposed, this objective is not diluted and ‘lost’ in the midst of so many others. We therefore believe that specific funding should be in place for the Daphne programme and that this funding should be greater than for the previous programmes, in view of existing needs. Given the importance that small women’s organisations, trades unions and various other NGOs have in defending and promoting women’s rights and combating the violence affecting them, we think the report needed to set out clear measures enabling these organisations to access the programme’s funds.</literal>

               –Set up in 1997, the Daphne programme has made its mark as the only EU programme seeking to combat violence against women, children and young people. Since it was established, the programme has thrown light on new forms of violence. Parliament has pointed out in numerous resolutions that the Daphne programme has been underfunded so far, and has stated its intention of ensuring that it has sufficient funding so that it can tackle the real problems.

In 2000, the Daphne initiative was transformed into a multiannual programme covering the period 2000-2003 and allocated funding of EUR 20 million. The programme aroused a great deal of interest, both in the European Union and in various international bodies working to stop the commercial sexual exploitation of children.

The Daphne II and Daphne III programmes were launched in 2004 and 2007 respectively, with an average annual budget of EUR 10 million for Daphne II and EUR 16.7 million for Daphne III, which formed part of the general programme ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice’. I believe that the objectives of the programme, that is to say, to prevent and combat all forms of violence against women, children and young people and to create a coordinated, coherent and effective EU policy, are still relevant to the current needs of the target groups.</literal>

               –Between 20 and 25% of women in the European Union have experienced physical acts of violence at least once during their adult lives and more than 10% have suffered from sexual violence involving the use of force. Similarly, 26% of children and young people report physical violence. Given the extent of this violence, the European Daphne programme was set up in 1997 to protect these women, these young people and these children and since then, it has been a genuine success. The resolution that we adopted, and which I, of course, supported, welcomes the actions carried out within this programme and calls for their renewal for the 2014-2020 period. More specifically, I would like to highlight certain aspects: our resolution firstly calls for more funding to be channelled into projects aimed at alerting the young to new forms of violence (social networks, Internet child pornography, etc.). Our resolution goes on to encourage NGOs to take part and get involved, given their crucial role in supporting victims. Finally, it is important that this instrument should retain its name and its independence to maintain the visibility of the programme, and it also needs a budget which is at least on a par with that of the previous programme.</literal>
